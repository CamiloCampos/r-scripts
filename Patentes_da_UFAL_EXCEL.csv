FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]The present invention refers to the application of extracts, mainly the alcoholic, hydroalcoholic, and aqueous extracts of the bark, bark seam, stem, and seedpod skin of Abarema cochliocarpos (Gomes) Barneby & Grimes and/or Stryphnodendron barbatiman, Stryphnodendron coriaceum Benth., S. diacolor Benth., S. pulcherrimum (Wildd) Hoch., Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville, Stryphnodendron obovatum Benth., Stryphnodendron polyphyllum M., and Pithecellobium avaremotemo Mart., popularly known as barbatiman, isolated and in mixtures of different proportions of these products and/or together with extract(s) from other natural and/or synthetic sources in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, in particular presentations for use at the genital area that can be applied to the vaginal, vulvar, perianal, anal, or penile regions in the form of soaps, dyes, w/o and o/w emulsions (ointments, creams, and gels), aerosols, pastes, ovules, suppository, and the like, for treatment (as adjuvants) of infections related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) and, consequently, for cervical cancer prophylaxis, comprising formulations containing the aforementioned extracts, fractions of these materials and/or chemical component(s), used as active principles and/or pharmacological excipient(s).
[0002]The human papillomavirus is a DNA virus of the family Papoviridae, with more than 100 identified types of virus, with some types responsible for vulgar moles, others for anogenital moles and nasopharyngeal papillomas.The HPV does not act on oncogenesis alone; other factors, such as the host's immunological and nutritional status and the use of tobacco and alcohol, also participate together in this process.The HPV reaches the nucleus of basal cells via micro relations with the epithelium, and the first signs of virus genome transcription appear 4 weeks after infection.The incubation period lasts between 3 and 18 months, and the persistence of lesions can be evaluated in weeks, months, or years.As the cell differentiates, antigen production and virus replication on the surface cells increase, and the amount of DNA increases toward the epithelium surface.During this process, genomic proteins and capsid-related structural proteins accumulate.
[0003]HPV infection is characterized by apparent, vegetative, vascularized, sessile lesions with multiple papillary projections, designated condyloma acuminata.Most of these lesions are associated with HPV 6 (65%) and 11 (20%); the remaining lesions are associated with less common HPV types.HPV infection occurs more commonly in patients aged between 16 and 25 years.Vaginal lesions caused by HPV can coexist with vulvar moles in 30% of the patients, and over 85% of these patients will have cervical infection.

About Barbatiman
[0004]Abarema cochliocarpos, one of the species popularly known as barbatiman, is endemic in Brazil and belongs to the family Mimosaceae.This species is a small to average-sized leafy tree with compound leaves, inflorescence in globose glomeruli, slightly yellow flowers, and greyish white seeds.It is widely employed in natura as a medicinal plant in Brazil (Santos et al., 2007).This plant is popularly known as barbatimão, babatimão, bordão-de-velho (Braga, 1976: p. 89).According to ethnopharmacology, it is used against skin infectious process, as a healing compound, and is also employed to combat leucorrhea and moles (Corrêa, 1984; p. 199, 200).
[0005]Several literature works have described the chemical composition of the tannins present in the barbatiman barks.The protobinetinidins (Mello & Nahrstetd, 1996), the dimeric proanthocyanidin present in the ketone-soluble extract (Mello et al., 1999), displays anti-inflammatory activity (Lima et al., 1998).

STATE OF THE ART
[0006]The treatments described under the state of the art and commonly employed include cytotoxic drugs, surgical procedures, and therapy with different immunomodulatory drugs and can be realized using different drugs as presented below:
[0000]a) Desiccant acids: dichloroacetic or trichloroacetic acids are effective on humid lesions of mucous membranes because of the high water content of these tissues.These acids can be directly applied on the moles, preferentially under skin magnification.The rate of local relapses is high -- around 30%. 
 b) Podophyllin: its biological effect is due to its antimitotic action.It has systemic toxic effects -- neurological and hepatorrenal toxicity and bone marrow suppression.It is contraindicated during pregnancy.Its application should be restricted to the keratinized skin.The success rate is 20-40% in six months. 
 c) Focal physical destruction: electrocauterization, cryosurgery, or laser ablation can be employed.These procedures are indicated in the case of persistent skin lesions in which thick keratin prevent penetration of the topical drug.Topical therapy can initially treat condylomatosis; however, primary therapy fails with a secondary relapse rate is approximately 50%.Following treatments will depend of the aspect of the lesion.Vulgar, recurrent, and keratinized moles are better treated using physical destruction methods.
[0007]The extended and diffuse picture of warts that grow between treatment sessions respond better to treatment with interferon and continuous topical therapy.The interferons alpha  (derived from leukocytes), beta  (derived from fibroblasts), and gamma  (derived from lymphocytes) are used to treat viral infections, and they induce antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunostimulating effects.Intralesion interferon exacerbates the response to topical podophyllin (Douglas et al., 1990); systemic interferon provides added benefits in recurrent juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis (Leventhal et al., 1991) and in the treatment of laryngeal diseases in older patients.
[0008]5-fluorouracil (5-FU), it is antimetabolic and is indicated as coadjuvant in the treatment of vaginal condylomatosis, inhibiting the production of ribonucleic acid and DNA.The treatment must be individualized to avoid chronic vaginal ulcerations.Keratinized and flat vaginal lesions do not respond to the treatment as well as classic condylomas.The use of 5-FU has been discontinued due to the high rate of complications, including chronic ulcerations, chemical vaginitis, adenosis, and vulvar vestibulitis.Administration can be topical, intralesional, or parenteral; results vary, and responses are usually dose-dependent.High costs and side effects limit the use of 5-FU.
[0009]On the other hand, Imiquimod creams act as modifiers of the immune response, inducing multiple subtypes of interferon-alpha  and of some cytokines, including the Tumoral Necrosis Factor (TNF) and interleukins.This chain stimulates killer cells, T cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages, enhancing antitumor activity.It is indicated for the treatment of condyloma acuminata of the external and perianal genitalia, and it can be used during pregnancy (class B).Its use in occluded mucous membrane, like vagina and cervix, is outlawed due to the higher absorption of these mucosae.Common side effects associated with the combination with interferon are erythema, itching, scaling, and edema.The cure rate is as high as 50-56%; on rare occasions -- in less than 5% of the patients -- there are reports of headache, myalgia, and flu-like symptoms.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0010]As stated, it is urgent that new drugs to treat HPV infections are made available.Therefore, the present instrument of industrial property presents phytotherapic drugs that include the active principles of Abarema cochliocarpos (Gomes) Barneby & Grimes and other natural or synthetic substances in their formulations.Pre-clinical and clinical tests were used to evaluate the products proposed in the invention modality presented here.The results of these tests represent a new alternative for the treatment of infections caused by HPV and cervical cancer prophylaxis.
[0011]Contrary to the solutions described in the section about the state of the technique, the use of barbatiman ointment in the treatment of HPV offers the following advantages: absence of side effects, facile self-application, unrestricted use in children and pregnant women, low local relapse rates (around 11%), and low cost (the raw material is easily found in the Brazilian flora).Moreover, this ointment can be used internally; that is, in the rectal, vaginal, penile, and buccal mucosae without risking side effects.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PATENT
[0012]1. Obtaining the extracts: Barbatiman (Abarema cochliocarpos) barks were dry and crushed in an electric mill (1 Kg) and extracted by maceration with ethanol (92.8 deg. GL) (3 L * 2) for 72 h. The resulting ethanolic extract was filtered through filter paper (Watman no. 2) and concentrated to a volume of 0.1 L in a rotary evaporator working at 60 deg. C. A mass of 0.4 kg of the dry extract was obtained, which corresponded to a yield of 35 to 45% (p/p) in relation to the dry weight of the barks and bark seams.The aqueous extract provides a yield of 33% (w/w) while the hydroalcoholic extract (9:1) provides a yield of 38%, using preparation procedures identical to those employed in the case of the hidrated ethanolic extract (92.8 deg. GL). 
 2.Preparation of the ointment: The ointment was prepared by heating 0.4 L of vegetable oil (canola) and edible paraffin (70 g) in a water bath at 60 deg. C. for 30 min.The concentrated volume of the barbatiman alcoholic extract (0.1 L) obtained in item 1 was slowly added to the mixture, which was homogenized manually by using a wooden spoon and making uniform circular movements for 10 min. 
 3.The container was removed from the water bath, and homogenization was left to proceed for 15 min.The resulting ointment -- ready for use -- was transferred to five 100-mL plastic containers that should have between 20 and 30% (p/p) of the active principle.

Phytochemical Studies
[0013]The phytochemical, toxicological, pharmacological and clinical studies with the barbatiman alcoholic, aqueous, and hydroalcoholic extracts are presented below.

Botanical Material Gathering
[0014]The barbatiman extracts were obtained from the reddish barks and bark seams of the stem and from the skin of mature seedpods.The extracts contained at least 20% (w/w) of tannins.The barks and bark seams were collected from the stem of healthy Abarema cochliocarpos plants growing in two different locations: Campus A.C. Simões, UFAL, Maceió, state of Alagoas, Brazil, and Mata Atlântica in the region of Coruripe, state of Alagoas, Brazil.The reddish skin of mature seedpods also contained the studied active principles.A specimen of the plant Abarema cochliocarpos was deposited in the herbarium of Instituto do Meio Ambiente do Estado de Alagoas (IMA-AL, Environment Institute of the state of Alagoas) under number mac 8830.

Biological Tests
[0015]The biological and microbiological activities of the hydrated alcoholic extract (ethanol 92.8 deg. GL) of the barks and bark seams of barbatiman were conducted on Artemia salina larvae and four Candida species (leveduriform fungi).The assays were conducted in the Laboratório de Química de Produtos Naturais/IQB/UFAL (Laboratory of Natural Products Chemistry of the Chemistry Institute of the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil) and Laboratório de Microbiologia Aplicada/ICBS/FAL (Laboratory of Applied Microbiology of ICBS of the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil)

Microbiological Tests
[0016]The microbiological tests were carried out using the alcoholic extract of the barks and bark seams of the barbatiman stem at a concentration of 100 mg mL-1, resuspended in a solution of methanol/water 1:2 (v/v).
[0017]To determine the antimicrobial activity, the modified Kirby and Bauer agar diffusion method was employed (MOURA, 1977).The microorganisms were transferred to tubes containing 2 mL of BHI liquid medium and incubated at 37 deg. C., for 24 h. Turbidity indicated bacterial growth.Next, 1 mL of BHI (approximately 109 microorganisms/mL) was added to tubes containing 12 mL of agar Mueller Hinton at a temperature of 45 deg. C., and the content was placed on plates containing a bacteriological agar base with formation of wells (0.7 cm).A control assay was also conducted for each microorganism, using the standard antimicrobial agent -- chloramphenicol (30 mu g mL-1), tetracycline (30 mu g mL-1), itraconazole (11.6 mu g mL-1), ketoconazole (11.6 mu g mL-1), fluconazole (700 mu g mL-1), and nystatine (350 mu g mL-1).Then, 40 mu L of the ethanolic extract resuspended in methanol/water (1:2) was added to each well.The plates were incubated at 37 deg. C. for 24 h. The halos were measured using halometers.Halos >= 10.0 mm indicated antimicrobial activity.All the tests were accomplished in duplicate, and the results were determined using the average inhibition, according to LIMA et al., 2002.
[0018]The antimicrobial activity evaluation studies of the extracts were conducted in vitro, using the following microorganisms: Bacteria -- Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Salmonella enteriditis and Leveduriform fungi -- Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, and Candida guilliermondi, all obtained from the fungi collection of the Laboratory of Applied Microbiology -- L@MA, ICBS-UFAL.
[0019]The hydroethanolic extracts were active against all the assayed microorganisms.In some cases, the results were better than those achieved with the tested antibiotics, as in the case of the P. aeruginosa strains BAC 57, BAC 101, BAC 104, BAC 105, and BAC 125.
[0020]The hydroethanolic extract gave satisfactory results against 100% of the 12 tested S. aureus strains, especially in the case of the multiresistant strains BAC 95 and BAC 97.
[0021]The hydroethanolic extract provided the best results against the following strains of leveduriform fungi of the genus Candida: C. albicans FUN 05 (halo=24 mm), C. tropicalis FUN 36 (halo=18 mm), C. krusei FUN 11 (halo=24 mm), and C. guilliermondi FUN 46 (halo=23 mm).
[0022]All the tested extracts were active against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and fungi of the genus Candida.The results attested to the broad antimicrobial spectrum of the barks, pods, and seeds of A. cochliocarpos against clinically important microorganisms.

Toxicological Tests
[0023]The toxicological tests were accomplished on Artemia salina microlarvae and Mus musculus mice.
[0024]The toxic activity evaluation of the alcoholic extract (92.8 deg. GL), was conducted in saline medium using recently hatched Artemia salina leach microlarvae, at concentrations of 10, 100, and 200 mu g mL-1.
[0025]For the conduction of the bioassays it was used the methodology described by Santos Pimenta L P, Pinto G B, Takahashi J A, Silva L G, and Boaventura M A; Biological screening of Annonaceous Brazilian Medicinal Plants using Artemia salina (brine shrimp test), Phytomedicine 10 (2-3) 209-212, with adaptations.Each solution was assessed in triplicate, using ten A. salina larvae.This experiment was performed at room temperature (26-28 deg. C.), under artificial light, for a period of 24 consecutive hours.A control test was carried out using 5 mL of the saline solution and ten A. salina larvae under the same experimental conditions as the aforementioned tests.These bioassays showed that the alcoholic extract did not display toxicity at concentrations up to 100 mu g mL-1.
[0026]Sixteen healthy adult male and female Mus musculus mice were used for LC50 (Lethal Concentration) determination.The mice were weighed in a semi-analytical scale (0.001 g) and divided into four groups.The mice belonging to groups 1, 2, and 3 were intraperitonially inoculated with 70, 75, and 80 mu L of the barbatiman hydroethanolic extract, resuspended in water at 0.1 g mL-1, respectively.The Group 4 (control) was intraperitoneally inoculated with 80 mu L of distilled water.The dose that killed 50% of the inoculated mice within 96 h was considered lethal.The dead mice were submitted to autopsy for removal of the liver and spleen, which were weighed on a semi-analytical scale.The mice that remained alive were anesthetized by inhalation of sulfuric ether and, according to the procedure above, their liver and spleen were removed and weighed in a semi-analytical scale.
[0027]LC50 was found to be 75 mu L of the hydroethanolic extract of the barks and bark seams of barbatiman -- corresponding to a dose of 250 mg Kg-1.The tested mice presented a metabolism reduction and tachycardia.

Pharmacological Tests
[0028]The pharmacological, preclinical, and clinical evaluations of the barbatiman hydroethanolic extract were conducted in vitro and in vivo for the following activities: primary skin irritation, acute ocular irritation, healing capacity, and induction of abortion.
[0029]The male and female mice of the species Mus musculus used in the experiments were obtained from the biotherium of CCBi/UFAL and CCBS/UFS.The albino rabbits of the New Zealand lineage were provided by the breeding site of the county of Maceió, state of Alagoas, Brazil.The animals were treated for parasites and allowed to acclimatize in the biotherium of CCBi/UFAL.
[0030]The primary skin irritation tests were carried out according to BRITO (1994) and consisted in applying the drug onto the integral animal skin.Three albino rabbits were employed.The animals were placed in individual cages at room temperature, in 12-hour dark-light cycle, with animal food (PURINA) and water ad libitum.The rabbits were shaved 24 hours prior to application of the tested compound.Four application sites were defined, two of which were submitted to abrasion.Each rabbit had its own control application site.Using a single dose, 500 mu L of the crude ethanolic extract of the barks (0.1 g mL-1) were applied in a single dose, on a gauze, that was then placed on the rabbit skin.The gauze compress was fixed with hypoallergic adhesive tape.
[0031]The animals exposed to the drugs were housed in separate cages for four hours.At the end of the exposure time, the target skin region was washed with water and observed at 1, 24, and 72 hours after removal of the compress.At the site of drug application, the formation of erythema, scars, or edemas was examined, according to a system employed by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act of the United States of America.
[0032]Skin redness, without edema, was detected during the first 60 minutes after gauze removal in the assay involving the scarred skin.The redness had disappeared when the skin was examined after 24 hours of removal of the gauze compress.
[0033]According to BRITO (1994), to obtain the degree of skin irritation elicited by a substance, it is necessary to add the subtotal and divide by 4, which corresponds to erythema of the integral and scarred skin and erythema and edema of the integral and scarred skin, which gives the degree of skin irritability of the substance.A degree of 0.25 was obtained, which classifies the substance (0-1) as non-irritant.
[0034]The acute ocular irritation test was conducted in order to analyze reversible alterations to the rabbits' eyes originated from instillation of the hydroethanolic extract of barbatiman barks.
[0035]Four healthy male albino rabbits of the New Zealand lineage were selected for the test.The rabbits were housed in individual cages at room temperature, in 12-hour dark-light cycles, with animal food (PURINA) and water ad libitum.Both eyes of each rabbit were examined 24 hours before application of the tested compound, in order to avoid working with animals that had pre-existing lesions or ocular defects.
[0036]The barbatiman hydroethanolic extract was resuspended in water at a concentration of 0.1 g mL-1, and 100 mu L of the extract was instilled into the conjunctiva of the rabbit's right eye, after carefully lifting the lower eyelid of the ocular globe.The rabbits' eyes were not washed during the first 24 hours after instillation of the drug.Distilled water (100 mu L) was applied to the left eye of each animal, as control.The fourth rabbit received 100 mu L of HCl 1% in the right eye, and the left eye served as control.
[0037]The rabbits' eyes were examined 24, 48, and 72 hours after instillation, with the aid of an ophthalmoscope.Macroscopic lesions in the iris, cornea, and conjunctiva were examined and compared with the control eye.The ocular lesions were rated according to an illustrated guidebook on ocular irritation (BRITO, 1994).
[0038]According to the tests carried out in vitro, instillation of 100 mu L of the barbatiman extract at 20% did not elicit any perceptible reaction in the cornea, iris, and conjunctiva as compared with the positive (HCl 1%) and negative (distilled water) controls.The pharmacological tests did not evidence ocular alterations or skin primary irritation.
[0039]Thirty-six healthy adult albino rabbits of the New Zealand lineage weighing between 1.250 and 1.700 Kg were used for the healing tests.The animals were shaved and housed in individual cages at room temperature, in 12-hour light-dark cycles, with PURINA animal food and water ad libitum.
[0040]The rabbits were anesthetized with local administration of lidocaine hydrochloride and inhalation of sulfuric ether.Four incisions were made on the skin of each rabbit until the subcutaneous layer was reached.A distance of 3 cm was maintained between each incision.
[0041]The animals were divided into three groups.The group A, control, received NaCl 0.9% solution during the 14 days of treatment period.Group B was treated with rifamycin and group C received the ethanolic extract of barbatiman barks, resuspended in water (0.1 g mL-1).The incisions remained open, and the rabbits were treated from the first day of the incision until the 14th day after the incision was made.On the 7th day, pieces were removed from 1/3 of the rabbits and part of the liver for histological analysis, and the animals were then killed.On 14th day, the remaining rabbits were killed, and the pieces and part of the liver were removed for histological analysis.
[0042]Macroscopic analyses were accomplished in order to determine the degree of retention scar healing and microscopic analyses in terms of epithelization degree, intensity and type of inflammatory reaction, and presence of neovascularization, as described by ARAUJO et al. (1998).
[0043]The incisions treated with barbatiman, rifamycin, and sterile saline on a daily basis presented different healing profiles.The barbatiman extract displayed better activity until 72 hours of treatment and purulent secretion was not present, which does not happen in tests with rifamycin and saline solution that present purulent secretion.
[0044]Barbatiman exhibited excellent healing activity, verified mainly during the first 72 hours of treatment, acting better than rifamycin and the saline solution.Barbatiman favored disappearance of purulent secretion and favored hyperemia and the appearance of granulation tissue.
[0045]To test the abortion induction, twenty-eight healthy adult mice, 21 female and 7 male, were used.One male and three female mice were left to mate for 96 hours.The males were not included in the steps following mating; the females were separated into three groups -- eight, eight, and five mice were included in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.Group 1 received heated aqueous extract of barbatiman barks at a concentration of 0.5% for four days after the mating period, alternating between water (12 hours) and extract (12 hours).Group 2 received the same barbatiman extract from day 5 to day 8 after the mating period, alternating between water (12 hours) and extract (12 hours).Group 3 constituted the control and received only water throughout the experiment.
[0046]The mice were weighed during the experiment.On day 20 after mating, the pregnant mice were anesthetized with sulfuric ether and placed on the surgical table in supine position, to facilitate surgical incision.An infra-umbilical median longitudinal laparotomy was carried out.Using a pair of scissors and a pair of dissection tweezers, the skin and muscle of the abdominal wall were lifted after the incision.The peritoneum was opened, showing the whole abdominal cavity, and the number of uterine implants and reabsorptions was counted.
[0047]Barbatiman ingestion by pregnant mice did not alter the fertility or the implant index.Therefore, barbatiman does not alter the initial cell division mechanisms or interferes in the implantation processes.

Pre-Clinical Trials
[0048]The gel or ointment containing the barbatiman extract was tested on the ocular globe of test animals using the method described by Draize J H (1956) The skin game.International Record of Medicine and General Practice Clinics, 169 (1), p. 37-39. The irritation score was equal to zero, which corresponds to a non-irritant product.The antiedematous activity of this product was tested using the carrageenan rat paw edema model; the product had effect similar to that of dexamethasone, without the collateral effects of this drug.
[0049]Compared with the standard treatment (fibrinolysin+deoxyribonuclease+chloroamphenicol), the healing activity of the barbatiman hydroethanolic extract, formulated as cream, was evident in the open wound model healing test.The tests using the ointment led to formation of a thick scab, which reduced irritability, pain, and light bleeding.

Clinical Evaluation of the Barbatiman Extracts
[0050]The clinical studies on the barbatiman extracts showed their anti-inflammatory and healing action in women with cervicitis and cervicovaginitis.This pharmacological action was demonstrated by clinical practice in folk medicine.Recent studies on the clinical and biopharmaceutical aspects of barbatiman extracts revealed its efficient action in vaginitis, cervicitis, and cervicovaginitis as compared with standard drugs -- barbatiman extracts led to disappearance of discharge, unpleasant odor, itching, and pain in a significant number of patients with these gynecologic conditions.
[0051]The ointment containing 20% (w/w) of the barbatiman hydroethanolic extract, offered free of charge, was topically applied twice a day, for 60 days.The patients were examined every 15 days (a total of 2 visits per patient enrolled in the study).On these visits, a macroscopic evaluation was conducted, in order to verify the possible therapeutic effect of the extract on perianal, vulvar, and penile lesions.
[0052]This work consisted of a prospective study.Fifty male and female patients aged between 21 and 50 years, with clinical diagnosis for condyloma acuminatum (HPV), assisted at the Proctology outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), Brazil, between October 2002 and September 2009, and were included in the study.All the lesions were photographed at the beginning, during, and at the end of the period proposed for treatment.The patients were informed about the work and agreed to participate.All the patients were followed up; lesions disappeared in 45 patients, the other patients quit the study and did not return to the clinic.Forty-five patients saw total regression of the lesions, without relapse.In general clinical evaluation of the phytotherapic, compound, it can be concluded that the product afforded highly significant clinical results in the treatment of infections by HPV.","INAD

Descriptive Report: “PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR PREPARATION OF A MEDICATION TO TREAT DORES NEUROPATICAS, PAINS ASSOCIATES TO OPERATIVE THE CHRONIC DEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND IN AFTER PAINFUL OF ANIMALS”
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention mentions the development to it of Pharmaceutical Composition, understanding Triancinolona, Bupivacaina and Etanol in watery vehicle, the form of suspension, with indication of perineural injectable use, in small e great animal. The referred to composition has as therapeutical effect the reduction or abolition of the sensation of pain in chronic degenerative syndromes, postoperative neuropaticas pains and in painful of animals, through the chemical action of neurolise of the ethanol.
ANTECEDENTS OF THE INVENTION AND PREVIOUS TECHNIQUE
The antialgica therapy is used to interrupt the ways of nervous transmission intentionally, to alliviate the pain of different types, origins and intensities, between them the chronic or neuropatica pain, that for itself proper becomes a serious disease, to the times responsive only to the psicotropicos and tranquilizantes.
Of this form, necessary palliative procedures in the control of chronic pain become, between them the infiltration or perineural injection of neuroliticas solutions, that go to interrupt the ways of nocicepcao in the transmission of the nervous stimulus, abolishing palliatively pain. Active Beginnings as alcoois, fenois and chloride of amonio, among others, already widely are used in analgesia in carrying human patients of cancer in terminal phases and in equines with chronic lombalgia and degenerative syndromes you trim (related to the hoof and interfalangicas joints) (PI0317667-3 A2, PI0509720-7 A2, PI0411290-3 A2).
The perineural injection of neurolitica solution aims at to the attainment of Neurolise, that is, the destruction of nervous one weaveeed to promote analgesia, in this in case that, accomplished chemically. The injury in a peripheral nerve can cause since a light and transitory physical deficit, until total loss of classified in three categories, in sequence increasing the sensitive and/or motor function, Sendo in accordance with the gravity: neuropraxia, axoniotemese and neurotemese. In the neuropraxia, loss of the conduction of the nervous impulses, however SEM occurs structural degeneration of the nerve, what it allows the return of the function; in axoniotemese, the injury is more serious than the previous one and same that does not have loss of the anatomic continuity of the nerve, walleriana degeneration exists, however still it has regeneration possibility; finally neurotemese is the injury most serious, with discontinuity and destruction of the neural elements. In cases of chronic degenerative syndromes axoniotemese or neurotemese is aimed at, due to the drawn out time of analgesia.
However, contraindications in the application of the neuroliticos, dependant medications of concentration and individual reaction exist, being able will cause neuritis and more still intensify pain, until neurolise either established.
In humans, the used substances more for peripheral blockades are the alcohol and the phenol. The ideal agent would have to be capable to interrupt only nervous staple fibers selectively, however, the agents comumente used, frequently causes an indiscriminate destruction of the fabric nervous, being able to cause much pain at the moment of the injection, with inflammation of some days after-infiltration.
The ethanol is the neurolitico of more intense and lasting effect, however the indices of neuritis are bigger in respect to the use of the fenois, what it discourages the anesthesiologists and doctors veterinarians to use it.
One of the most known neuroliticas solutions is the “Pitcher Plant” in the Benzilic Alcohol vehicle 0.75%, known commercially as Sarapin®. It Is a neurolitico alkali of human use, indicated in the painful syndrome of the sciatic nerve, intercostal neuralgia, neuritis, lumbar neuralgia and of the nerve triplet, among others. In animals, its more common use has been for chemical ablation of the digital nerve to palmar in equines with chronic diseases of the foot, however, divergences how much to the time of action of the drug exist.
In equines, the Sarapin® and the Chloride of Amonio to 2% are the pharmaceutical compositions more used to infiltrate peripheral nerves of the members and spinal nerves, with length of the effect of two to three months. The ethanol and phenol are used in diverse bands of concentration, however when the neurolitica action is satisfactory, the local inflammatory reaction is intense and painful. Nicoletti et al. (Braz. J. vet. Res. anim. I Know., Sao Paulo, v. 44, N. 6, P. 401-407, 2007), in comparative study of the infiltration of Sarapin® (Group A) and etanolica solution to 99.5% (Group B), in the Palmar Nerve of equines, had noticed that with 150 days sensitivity had come back in the group and with 180 days it was absent in Group B. However all the animals of Group B had had local inflammatory reaction in the application place, that was extended for three to four weeks. In such a way the authors had proven the lasting action of the ethanol, however with the undesirable and restrictive local inflammatory reaction.
Seen the problems related to the ethanol as neurolitico agent and searching the optimum neuroliticas properties of the active beginning, the necessary becomes a pharmaceutical composition neurolitica effective etanolica, that allows the synergy of the individual effects. The clear present aims at the formulation of a pharmaceutical composition characterized to understand triancinolona, bupivacaina and ethanol in the suspension form, with components characterized to be in the preparation of a medication to treat neuropaticas pains, pains associates to the painful postoperative chronic diseases degenerative and in of small e great animal, configuring an invention of innovative character in the market of Animal Health, searching will take care of to the equine species and other mammals of small the great transport, that suffer with chronic or neuropatica pain.
DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE
The graph presents the result of the application of the composition proposal in this patent, compared with the result of the use of the ethanol and the Sarapin®.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention mentions a singular and effective pharmaceutical composition to it of Triancinolona, Bupivacaina and Etanol, in watery vehicle, for perineural injectable use in small species of the great animals (use veterinarian). The aim is to cause neurolise in peripheral nerves, searching the abolition of the nervous transmission and consequent analgesia, in the cases of syndromes that cause chronic pain in the Medicine Veterinary Medicine.
The palliative treatment of chronic or neuropatica pain in patients with terminal cancer, degenerative syndromes (as the syndromes you trim of equines and displasia lame person-femural in dogs) and diverse idiopaticas pains is of utmost importance in the Medicine Veterinary Medicine, mainly in view of the cordial treatment of small animals and sporting requirements of the equines, what it propitiates increment in the animal well-being. Moreover, she is indicated operative or clinical invention in after of painful conduction, where the control of pain will positively assist in the prognostic and well-being of the patient.
The invention supplies a pharmaceutical formulation in suspension, where the components offer more appropriate the neurolitico effect of what each one of the components separately. Thus, the composition understands Ethanol, Bupivacaina and the Triancinolona, in watery vehicle, Sendo that these last components will attenuate the deleterious action of the ethanol, however taking advantage of its potential and lasting neurolitico effect. The preferred modality of the present invention, indicating the variations of concentrations of active ingredients is the following:
Cloridrato de Bupivacaina 1 to 5 mg/mL Hexacetonido de Triancinolona 2 to 6 mg/ml-
Ethanol 99,5 to 497,5 mg/mL
Watery Vehicle q.s.p.
The composition of the present invention understands Bupivacaina in the band enters 0,1 to 0.5% p v; Triancinolona in the band enters 0,2 to 0.6% p/v and Ethanol in the band of 9,95 to 49.75% p/v. The care Must be taken to work in amenas temperatures, therefore it can have degradation in temperatures above 40°C.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The use of causing pharmaceutical agents of neurolise is relatively common in human patients with terminal cancer and amputations of members, where the use of these substances alliviates chronic pain and avoids the “effect ghost”, palliatively developing the quality of life of the patient.
In medicine veterinary medicine, the use of neuroliticas solutions, in carriers of terminal neoplasias, still little it is explored, however the use in the case of amputations of members is indicated, mainly when these are distant.
On the other hand, the neuroliticas solutions widely are used in the eqOina medicine, postoperative chronic degenerative syndromes and painful. In the Medicine Veterinary Medicine, the equine species presents resulting chronic pain of degenerative processes in the extremity of the members, especially in feet, constituting one of the problems faced for the physician. More than a terco of the chronic lamenesses in the horse they are caused by located injuries it half to palmar of the foot, and improve temporarily or they are eliminated with blockade of the Digital nerve Palmar. Amongst the diseases you trim that many times do not answer satisfactorily to the conservativo or surgical treatment and result in chronic lameness, highlights it podosesamoidite or disease of navicular, breaking of navicular, ossification of the collateral cartilages of the phalanx you are distant, angular breaking or of the process to palmar of the phalanx you are distant and osteite you trim. Thus, one of the palliative procedures of election, in the attempt keeps in activity which went for horses of chronic pain, is the use of chemical agents pharmaceutical neuroliticos.
In small animals, much little is told in respect to the use of neuroliticos, however lame person-femural has resulted positive in displasia cases, through the denervacao of sensitive staple fibers, responsible for the inervacao of the capsule to articulate lame person-femural. These results also already are obtained through neurolise chemical of these sensitive staple fibers, what they also indicate the use of the intended suspension.
Different chemical substances have been used to interrupt the nociceptivas ways intentionally, as alcohol, phenol, glycerol, leave amonio, clorocresol, nitrate of silver and spastic saline solution.
When an injury in the nervous fiber is produced, one of the main histopatologicos findings is the degeneration walleriana, important to obtain the desired clinical effect of long term. The persistence of the basal blade around of the cell of Schwann, allows the appropriate regeneration of nervous staple fibers, avoiding the training of neuromas. In humans, the used substances more for peripheral blockades are the alcohol and the phenol. The ideal agent would have to be capable to interrupt only nervous staple fibers selectively, however, the agents comumente used, frequently causes an indiscriminate destruction of the fabric nervous, what she can make impracticable the use for the professionals.
The ethanol is one of the most known neuroliticos, acts extracting the fosfolipideos and cholesterol of the fabric nervous, beyond provoking the precipitation of lipoproteins and mucoproteinas, and when injected directly in determined concentration and volume, it provokes blockade of the nervous conduction, being able to cause numb or hipoestesia, beyond paralysis, to affect the motor nerves. Still, he is known that the alcohol has its related neurolitico effect of the precipitation of lipoproteins and mucoproteinas in peripheral nerves, producing degeneration and damages in such a way in the cells of Schwann how much in the axonios and histological degeneration of the mielina can be observed, beyond focal flash points in the blocked nerve.
The great vanity of the use of the ethanol is its irritating property, that provokes pain in the place of the injection and presents ample diffusion through fabrics. Thus the fenois are preferred in peripheral blockades, in humans, to cause a lesser incidence of neuritis in respect to the alcoois. However, the effect of the fenois has minor length and minor intensity in comparison to the alcoois.
In the medicine veterinary medicine of equines one often uses the Sarapin® and Chloride of Amonio to 2% to infiltrate peripheral nerves of the members and spinal nerves. As the length of the effect it does not pass of two to three months, becomes it infiltration many times, what cause painful fibrositis and neuromas. The Sarapin® is a neurolitico alkali (benzilic alcohol to 0.75%), of human use, indicated mainly in the related painful syndromes to the sciatic nerve, intercostal neuralgia, neuritis, lumbar neuralgia and of the trigemio, among others, that it has its use. In Medicine Veterinary Medicine, one of its more common uses, has been for chemical ablation of the digital nerve to palmar in equines with disease of navicular, when injected directly in the nerve. The clinical improvement can last of 2 to 3 months. The ethanol and the phenol are used in diverse bands of concentration, however when the neurolitica action is satisfactory, the local inflammatory reaction is intense and painful.
Nicoletti et al. (Braz. J. vet. Res. anim. I Know., Sao Paulo, v. 44, N. 6, P. 401 - 407, 2007), in comparative study of the infiltration of Sarapin® (Group A) and Etanolica Solution to 99.5% (Group B), in the Palmar Nerve of equines, had noticed that with 150 days sensitivity had come back in the group and with 180 days it was absent in Group B. However all the animals of Group B had had local inflammatory reaction in the application place, that was extended for three to four weeks. In such a way the authors had proven the lasting action of the ethanol, however with the undesirable and restrictive inflammatory reaction. The authors of this patent had accomplished perineural infiltration of ethanol to 49.75% in 8 animals with distinct chronic diseases, who result in intense neuropatica pain. All the animals had presented hipoestesia or analgesia during 120 days, however five (62.5%) of the infiltrated animals had presented intense inflammatory and painful reaction (it Search Veterinary Medicine and Zootecnia in Mines Special Supplement V International Symposium of the Horse Athlete, Belo Horizonte, Abr /Mai /Jun, year XXI, v.109, p.54-55, 2011).
In such a way, the use of the ethanol is restricted, therefore exactly Sendo a powerful and lasting neurolitico, the local reactions of neuritis and painful inflammation discredits its use, mainly in averages and high concentrations. Searching to use the neuroliticas properties of the ethanol and observing not the existence of patented neurolitica composition in Brazil, after years of research, developed it here described invention, where the ethanol is component of a composition in watery vehicle, in the suspension form, that still counts on Bupivacaina and Triancinolona.
The invention has as main advantage not to present the irritating action of the majority of the compositions of the market, beyond having more lasting therapeutical effect in respect to those that present amenas inflammatory reactions, as it is the case of the Sarapin®. The invention returns the composition most effective in the treatment of neuropaticas pains, resulting pains of painful postoperative chronic syndromes degenerative and for of small e great animal.
The local Anesthetic bupivacaina is an amide derived from xylidine, found commercially in the cloridrato form, highly lipossoluvel, that it is of the three to four times most powerful one than lidocaina, thus presenting analgesia of 2 to 6 hours. This property made with that bupivacaina composed the neurolitica suspension, mainly to abolish the local pain that the ethanol cause after infiltration. The use of the objective local anesthetic infiltration after keeps the patients with average of four hours of analgesia.
Triancinolona is one corticosteroide synthetic (anti-inflammatory esteroidal) sufficiently used in Opthalmology and Dermatology, introduced in the two last decades in the Orthopedics, with indications for bursites, tenossinovites and arthritides. The administration way can be intramuscular or through infiltrations intra- you will articulate, intra-tendineas or intra-bursites. The hexacetonido one of Triancinolona widely is used in medicine veterinary medicine them infiltrations intra-to articulate, with doses varying enters 6 to 18 MG for joint (dimension to articulate dependant), Sendo that lesser cause incidence of morphologic injuries it cartilage to articulate, comparative with the obtained results of the acetate infiltration of metilprednisolona.
The hexacetonido one of triancinolona constitutes the third ingredient of the Suspension Neurolitica Perineural for Use Veterinarian, therefore corticosteroide with five times is one more anti-inflammatory power that hidrocortisona, inhibiting thus mediating inflammatory places, edema, deposition of fibrina, fagocitica migration, capillary proliferation, deposition of cicatricial colageno and fabric. The action of the medication will be of utmost importance to avoid local edemas and inflammatory reactions in short term, common in concentrated perineurais infiltrations of ethanol.
In such a way, bupivacaina will supply analgesia in short term and triancinolona will act in average deadline, since the latency of the medication is of 3 to 6 hours, with therapeutical effect of 18 to 36 hours. The idea of the composition is to annul the deleterious action of the ethanol in the infiltrated region, making possible the use of this powerful and lasting neurolitico agent, characterizing the invention as unknown and effective.
The preferred modality of the present invention, indicating the variations of concentrations of active ingredients is the following:
Cloridrato de Bupivacaina 1 to 5 mg/ml
Hexacetonido de Triancinolona 2 to 6 mg/ml
Ethanol 99,5 to 497,5 mg/ml Watery Vehicle q.s.p.
The composition of the present invention contains Bupivacaina in the band enters 0,1 to 0.5% p v; Triancinolona in the band enters 0,2 to 0.6% p/v and of Ethanol in the band of 9,95 to 49.75% p/v.
The Pharmaceutical Composition characterized to understand triancinolona, bupivacaina and ethanol in the suspension form, with components characterized to be in the preparation of a medication to treat neuropaticas pains, pains associates to the painful postoperative chronic diseases degenerative and in of small e great animal is indicated for small palliative treatment of chronic or neuropatica pain in e great animal with terminal cancer, degenerative syndromes (as the syndromes you trim of equines and displasia lame person-femural in dogs), postoperative or clinical diverse idiopaticas pains and in of painful conduction, where the control of pain will positively assist in the prognostic and well-being of the patient.
EXAMPLE
In research accomplished for the authors entitled: Comparative Study of the Degrees of lameness in Equines infiltrated with Ethanol to 99.5%, Sarapin® and neurolitica Pharmaceutical Composicao in the Nerves Palmares de Equinos, observed of the M1 moments - daily pay-infiltration the M10 - 180 days, with pressure applied in the Central Point of the Sole, one searched to analyze and to compare the clinical results of analgesia between the invention, the ethanol to 99.5% and the Sarapin®, inducing the painful reaction in the sole through inductive experimental horseshoe of lameness (modified of Merkens and Schamhardt, Equ/ne Veterinary Jouma/, Suppl 6, p.99- 106,1983), evaluating the degrees of lameness between 1 and 4 according to the book: Adam (') s Lameness in Horses.da Ed. Wiley-Blackwell (2002). The results are in table 1, being able itself to conclude from the research:
1- The invention, called SNE, equalized it the analgesic results of the ethanol, with time of beginning of analgesia between 72 (3 days) and 96 hours (4dias) and persistent analgesic length after 180 days of infiltration (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Descriptive Report of Pioneer Patent DERIVED PIPERIDINICOS FROM (+CASSINA E (-) - SPECTALINA, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS I CONTEND THE SAME AND PROCESSES
FOR ITS PREPARATION
Field of the Invention the present invention mentions derived piperidinicos, in particular aril-hidrazonas and/or cinamicos esters and/or benzoic derivatives of (-) - Cassina and of (-) - Spectalina and its homologous ones.In particular, such composites had presented analgesic and antiinflammatory activity in pharmacological essays, being able to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including neuropathologies as the Disease of Alzheimer. The present invention also mentions to a process for the preparation of these composites and the pharmaceutical compositions I contend the same.
Antecedents of the Invention oxidativos Processes and the influence of the inflammation in the progress of the one OF
The processes redox perform the important paper in the aerobica generation of energy.Oxidant Species, by-products of the oxidation reactions - mitocondrial reduction, includes peroxide of hydrogen, radicals hidroxila and superoxides and, can will cause damage to the lipidios of membrane for peroxidacao, having increased its mediating rigidity and harming the communication - receiving (Am. J. Health Syst. Pharm. 1996, 53, 1545). The idea of that the inflammation in the fabric cerebral can contribute to the development of the Disease of Alzheimer (OF A) is based on studies involving patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with antiinflammatory nao-esteroidais (AINEs) (Am. J. Health Syst. Pharm. 1996, 53, 1545; Trends Pharm. Sci. 1994, 15, 447; Science 1993, 260, 1719). Moreover, interleucina-6 (IL-6) was detected in neurons and all the three types of cells that the SNC composes are capable of will synthetize ciclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) (Cur.
Med. Chem. 2002, 9, 83). The citocinas and proteins of acute phase are additional beepers of the inflammatory activation in the one OF. the IL-1 and IL-6 were identified in amyloid platelets, Sendo that the IL-1 seems will occur during the initial phase of training of the amyloid plate, and the IL-6 was detected in cerebral extracts of patients with OF. the IL-1 can will activate the astrocitos that, in turn, induce a protein series of acute phase, as the aiantiquimiotripsina (ai-ACT) that she is found in amyloid platelets.There the ACT can, then, the peptideo (3-amyloid will unite to it and to modulate the training of fibrilas of the protein (Cur. Med. Chem. 2002, 9, 83). Aril-hidrazonicos Agents with antiinflammatory activity the search for new antiinflammatory and analgesic agents has taken to active innumerable the short planning and of acil- and aril-hidrazonas of diverse molecular standards.The group of Prof. Eliezer J. Barreiro has if destacado internationally for the synthesis of some active ligantes capable to act on diverse mediators of the inflammation, whose resulted they had identified to diverse substitutes acil- and aril-hidrazonicos as an important farmacoforico group (Chemical New 2002, 25, 129; EUR. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 33, 225;
J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 1997, 8, 471; EUR. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 33, 189; Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000, 8, 2243; J. Mol. Str. 2000, 505, 11; II Medication 2002, 57, 999; Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004, 12, 3149).
Of the innumerable synthetized derivatives and that they had presented antiinflammatory activity, they can be destacados the 4-bromine-fenilacilhidrazona 1 (EUR. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 33, 225), 2-piridilarilhidrazonas 2-4 (EUR. J. Med. Chem. 1998, 33, 189), the fenilimidazoli1-4-acilhidrazonaS-N-substituted derivatives 5-9 (II Medication 2002, 57, 999) and fenotiazina-acilhidrazona 10 (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004, 12, 3149) (Figure 1). The rationalization of the obtained results and the studies of Relation Structure - Activity (REA) of substance tens indicated that the biological profile of the subunidades hidrazona (11) and acil-hidrazona (12) must be related with its relative acidity and its capacity of stabilization of radicals, mimetizando the encore-allyl fragment (13) of certain insaturados greasy acids, as I acidify it araquidonico (14).In such a way ciclooxigenase and 5-lipooxigenase contribuem for the inhibition of the active place of oxidativas (COX) catabolicas enzymes (LOX), responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandins, tromboxands and leucotrienos (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004, 12, 3149).

Botanical Description of Senna spectabilis Senna spectabilis is a arborea, pertaining plant to the Fabaceae family, known popularly as They Are - Joao, cassia-pity-northeast, canafistula-pity-beetle and wood - of - sheep, possessing as synonymies spectabilis botanists Cassia, or Cassia excelsa Schrad. Is plant deciduous (it loses its leaves in a specific station of the year), heliofita (it needs solar luminosity for its development), selective xerofita (it lives in surrounding dry and it presents structural and functional adaptations that minimizes the loss of water for evaporation, proper of barren regions or with long period of lull), pioneer, half-barren northeast characteristic (caatinga), but also is common in the squinted one of the state of Sao Paulo. It Occurs preferentially in deeper ground, drained well and of reasonable fertility.It Produces large amount of viable seeds annually.It Can reach of 6-9 meters of height, with trunk of 30-40 cm of diameter.Its leaves composed are pinadas (leaves with more than three foliolos leaving some points in raque central), having of 10-20 pairs of foliolos of 2-4 cm of length.Its you flourish are yellow, disposed in terminal inflorescencias, and its fruits possess cylindrical vegetable format.Its wood, due to the limitations of size, is taken advantage of only for the light object confection, would caixotaria, firewood and coal (Lorenzi, H. Brazilian Trees:
manual of identification and culture of arboreas plants of Brazil, 4. ed., New Odessa: Plantarum, 2002 vol. 1, p.184).
Senna spectabilis, a species of endemic tree of Atlantic Mata of the States of Sao Paulo until the Rio Grande Do Sul, demonstrated selective cytotoxic activity and was selected for fitoquimico study, aiming at the piperidinicos alkali isolation and other bioativos metabolitos.The chemical study of leaves, you flourish and spectabilis fruits of S. resulted in the piperidinicos alkali isolation innumerable (composites 15-25, Figure 2) (Tetrahedron 1995, 51, 5929; J. Nat. Prod. 1995, 58, 1683; J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 1996, 7, 157;
An. Acad. Bras. Ci. 1999, 71, 181; J. Nat. Prod. 2004, 67, 908; Viegas Jr, C.;
Dissertation, Sao Paulo State University, Brazil, 2003). (-) - Espectalina (15), already she had been identified in leaves, but it was much more abundant in you flourish them, having been obtained with income of 4% from the EtOH extract.Essays had in vivo evidenced peripheral analgesic activity and moderate antiinflammatory activity of 15 (Plant Medicate 2003, 69, 795;
Viegas Jr, C.; Dissertation, Sao Paulo State University, Brazil, 2003), beyond important toxic effect in you dose high.
Another isolated metabolito of you flourish them and of the fruits of this plant, 3-0-acetilespectalina (17), also demonstrated peripheral and central analgesic activity, SEM the observed toxic effects in 15.The recognition of a ""acetilcolina subunidade"" internalizada in the nucleus acetil-piperidinol of 17 (Figure 2) supported the hypothesis of that this substance could will also act as inhibiting of AChE. Using the existing bioisosterica relation between the functions carbonate and ester, the preparation of the cloridratos of the 3-O-acetilespectalina (26) and 3-O-Boc-espectalina carbonate was planned (27), beyond others three derivatives.The preliminary evaluation in vitro demonstrated that substances 26 and 27, was capable to inhibit the AChE completely, using itself as standard the galantamina, a commercial medication.More recent Studies had demonstrated that 26 and 27 are also capable to revert induced amnesia in mice and rats for escopolamina, SEM the toxic effects presented by the tacrina (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005, 13, 4184; W3O 2006/039767). Currently, these two candidates the anticolinesterasicos medication are in pre-clinical phase of evaluation.
In a more recent study using liquid chromatography connected the spectrometry of masses to the extract of you flourish them, extract fractions and spectabilis metabolitos of S. had discovered the occurrence of homologous, distinct co-metabolitos in the size of the lateral carbonic chain of 10 and 12 metilenicas units.These results had disclosed that in the reality (-) - espectalina (15) co-elui with its homologous inferior, (-) - Cassina (28), of which with difficulty it is separable, constituting a mixture 30 (15): 70 (28) (J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 2005, 68, 1431-1438).
(-) - Cassina (28), abundant raw material in you flourish them of precursory S. spectabilis and in semissintese of 26 and 27, presented moderate antiinflammatory activity, inhibiting 33% of the induced edema in leg of rats.In previous work of the inventors of the present invention, already she had been prepared a series of derivatives of (-) - espectalina (15) (composites 29-39, Figure 3) aiming at to obtain information on relation structure - activity (REA), toxicidade and identification of passiveis functional groups to be modified SEM loss of the analgesic activity.Of this study it was concluded that acetate 29 was the derivative most promising, presenting analgesic activity a little inferior of what 15, but SEM to present the observed toxic effects in essays of acute and subaguda toxicidade.In such a way hidroxila in the C-3 position of the cassina/espectalina was identified to the group as toxicoforico group (Viegas Jr, C.; Dissertation, Sao Paulo State University, Brazil, 2003; Viegas Jr C.; Moreira, M. S. A.; Barreiro, E. J.; Bolzani, V. S.; The 25 Summaries of ' Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Society of Chemistry, 2002; Viegas Jr C.;
Bolzani, V. S.; Barreiro, E. J.; Miranda. L. P.; Summaries of 26a Annual Meeting of the Brazilian Society of Chemistry, 2003).
These results, united with the fact to be been about IAChEs with a new molecular standard, had qualified composites 26 and 27 as new archetypes for studies daily pay - physicians.However, beyond the presence of a acetilcolina subunidade internalizada in the piperidinico nucleus, that is possibly the farmacoforico group responsible for the recognition for the AChE, little it is known on the possible influences of other present functions in the structure.
The positions - OH of the nucleus piperidinol and C=0 of the lateral chain can be white interesting for the preparation of same-type ester series carbamatos and hidrazonas, respectively.The planning of an ester series derived from the cassina (28) /espectalina (15) aims at to explore bioisostericas modifications in the C-3 position of the ring piperidinico in search of the modulation of the analgesic and antiinflmatoria activity.Moreover, these new series will be able to include, also, new derivatives piperidinicos carbamatos new anticolinesterasicos agents and piperidinil-arilidrazonas (Figure 4), constituting new structural composite standards with anticolinesterasica and antiinflammatory activity.For this new structural conception and of activity, these new composite series will be able to represent one important innovation in the molecular drawing of antiinflamtorios and anticolinesterasicos agents.Document W3O 2006/039767 tells the spectabilis use of the Senna species as source of piperidinicos derivatives.However, the derivatives obtained in this document are not derived from the cassina or from (-) - Cassina. It does not have another spectabilis referring document to the use of Senna.
Document US 2004/0197429 tells the direct extracted vegetal extract substance use of species of the order Fabales, Asterales, Apocinales, Arales, amongst others, with anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity simultaneously.However, the inventors of this invention had not proposed no chemical modification in the extracted made up of departure of the plant.He does not have no document related to the chemical modification of an extracted made up of departure of a species of the Fabaceae Family with simultaneous analgesic and antiinflammatory activity.
The diversity of observed biological activity for spectabilis piperidinicos alkalis of S. and its semissinteticos derivatives despertou the interest for study of the analgesic and antiinflammatory REA for derivatives of (-) - Cassina (28), aiming at the attainment of more powerful, less toxic analgesic and antiinflammatory agents and with an innovative structural standard.
Object of the Invention Is one of objects of the present invention to provide new therapeutical agents with analgesic and/or antiinflammatory activity.He Is another one of objects of the present invention to provide processes of preparation of a series derived from (-) - Cassina (28) and of (-) - Spectalina (15). In a preferential concretion, the derived referred to ones are piperidinilcarbamatos and aromatical esters prepared from reactions on the group hidroxila of the piperidinico nucleus and piperidinil-aril-hidrazonas prepared from reactions involving the C=0 function of the lateral chain of (-) - Cassina (28) and of (-) - Spectalina (15) and its homologous ones, obtained of spectabilis the etanolico extract of you flourish of Senna.

Antecedents of the Invention
The constituents of the identified propolis come Sendo in the entire world (Pietta, P.; Gardana, C; Scaglianti, M.; Simonetti, P., Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, V. 45, P. 390-399, 2007).The flavonoides, phenolic and terpenos acids are the main substances found and used to track the quality and, in some cases, to demonstrate the authenticity of the propolis of some geographic regions (Volpi, N.; Bergonzini, G., Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, V. 42, P. 354-361, 2006).Amongst the phenolic flavonoides and acids more comumente used as marking, they can be cited: quercetina, canferol, naringenina, crisina, pinocembrina, galangina (flavonoides); I acidify Gallic, I acidify cafeico, I acidify p-coumarico, I acidify ferulico, I acidify cinamicos and derivatives (I acidify phenolic), clerodanos (diterpenoides) (Rosalen, P.L.; Castro, M.L; Cury, J., New Chemistry, V. 30, N. 07, 1512-1517, 2007); (Yao, L; Jiang, Y.; Singanusong, R., Datta, N.; Raymont, K., Food Chemistry, V. 86, p.169-177, 2004); (Weston, R.J., Mitchell, K.R., Allen, K.L, Food Research International, V. 37, P. 166-174, 2004).
Each time increasing the popular use of propolis and its derivatives with antimicrobiana action (Sforcin, J.M; Fernandes Jr..; Lopes, C. the M.; Bankova, V.And Funari, S. R.C, J.Ethnopharmacology, V. 73, P. 243-249, 1998), anti-inflammatory (Khayyal, M.T.; el-Ghazaly, M.; el-Khatib. the S., Experimental and Clinicai Research, V. 19, P. 197-203, 1993), antiviral Drug (Vynograd, N.; Vynograd, I.; Sosnowisky, Z., Phytomedicine, V. 7, P. 1 -6, 2000), anticarcinogenica (Bazo. the P.; Rodrigues, M. the M.; Sforcin, J.M.; Camargo, J. L.V., Ribeiro, J.L.; Salvadori, D. M.F., Teratogenis, Carcinogenis and Mutagenis, V. 22, P. 183-194, 2002) and imunomodulatoria (Sforcin, J.M., Kanemo, R.Funari, S. R.C, Journal of Animal Venemous and Toxins, V. 8, P. 19-29, 2002); (Alone.; Faccioli, L.H., Sforcin, J.M., Journal of Ethnopharmacology, V.83, P. 93-97, 2003) comes demonstrating the great therapeutical power of the propolis in substitution to conventional synthetic medication.
The characterization of all these biological activities associates to the trend of use of natural products has resulted in an increase of the demand of propolis and products I contend propolis, as extracts, you cremate, ointments, tablets, capsules, or after (H.Menezes, M.Bacci Jr, S. D.Oliveira, F. C.Pagnocca, containingpropolis Antibacterial properties of propolis and products from Brazil, Apidologie, V. 28, P. 71 -76, 1997).
If treating to the propolis red, this was classified as 13° subtype of propolis Brazilian found in the regions of fens, lagoons, rivers and beaches northeast Brazilian enter the states of the Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraiba for the researcher (Andreas Daugsch, Cleber S.Moraes, Patricia Fort and Yong K.Park, Brazilian Red Propolis- Chemical Composition and Botanical Origin, eCAM 2008; 5(4) 435^141 doi: 10.1093/ecam/nem057).The main botanical origin of the propolis red if it must the Dalbergia plant ecastophyllum, locally known as Tail-of-Bugio, that it presents a liberated red resinous exudate of its sap.
National and international Researchers with expertise in propolis come identifying the constituents of the propolis red.They were identified 1 1 isoflavonoides and 1 chalcona of the propolis red Cuban and amongst these substances we can cite: Formononetina (Biochanina B), Bichanina, vestitol, orto-methyl vestitol, medicarpina, homopterocarpina, other pterocarpanos derivatives, liquiritigenina and isoliquiritigenina (chalcona) (Anna Piccinelli and col. J.Agric.Food Chem. 2005, 53, 9010-9016).Other subclasses of flavonoides were also identified, including new types of flavonoides of the propolis red of the northeast region and that we can cite: rutina, quercetina, luteolina, pinocembrina and formononetina, daidzeina, liquiritigenina, pinobanksina biochanina, the dalbergina one (neoflavonoides) (Andreas Daugsch, Cleber S.Moraes, Patricia Fort and Yong K.Park, Brazilian Red Propolis- Chemical Composition and Botanical Origin, eCAM, Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine, 2008; 5(4) 435-441 doi: 10.1093/ecam/nem057).
Researchers studying the propolis red of the region of the manguezais of Deodoro-Alagoas Marshal, had identified flavonoide crisina and quercetina, new isoflavonoides in the propolis red of Alagoas, vestitol, 2 (“) 4 (”) dihidroximetoxi flavana, benzofenonas isopreniladas, as well as I acidify ferulico and phenolic esters metoxieugenol, metileugenol, guiacol, dimetilicos esters of I acidify butanenodioico, methylic esters of I acidify hexadecanoico (Bruno B.Silva, Pedro L.Rosalen, Jaime A.Cury, Masaharu Ikegaki, Vinicius C.Souza, Alessandro Esteves and Severino M.Alencar Chemical Composition and Botanical Origin of Red Propolis, the New Type of Brazilian Propolis, eCAM, evidence based complementary and alternative medicine 2008; 5(3) 313-316, doi: 10.1093/ecam/nem059).
Additionally, researchers had identified 14 substances in the propolis red of the manguezais of Alagoas, amongst triterpenos them (cicloartenol, lupeol, elemicina, α-amirina and β-amirina), phenolic acids (anetol, eugenol and metileugenol), isoflavonoides (isosativan, medicarpina) (Boryana Trusheva, Milena Popova, Vassya Bankova, Svetiana Simova, Maria Cristina Marcucci, Patricia Laguna Miorin, Flavia da Rocha Pasin and Iva Tsvetkova, Bioactive Constituents of Brazilian Red Propolis, eCAM, evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine 2006; 3(2) 249-254, doi: 10.1093/ecam/nel006).
With seen short of molecules and its therapeutical targets for cure of the diseases, the propolis red has been submitted the diverse studies detailed on its biological activities.Research of identification and structural developed substance briefing new continues Sendo in the present substance identification new in the extract of propolis red.Chalcona, 3, 4, 2 (“), 3 were identified new (”) tetrahidroxchalcona and new flavonoide C-glicosilado, narigenina-8-C- hexoside, beyond (3S) - vestitol e (3S) - 7-O-metilvestitol (Adne the Righi, Thiago R Alves, Giuseppina Negri, Lucas M Marques, Henrique Breyer and Antonio Saiatino, Brazilian red you propolish: unreported substances, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, J I Know Food Agric 201 1; 91: 2383-2370, DOI 10.1002/jsfa.4468).Biological Research with the etanolico extract of propolis red and isolated substances, vestitol and neovestitol, had demonstrated to antiinflammatory activity in the concentration of 10mg/Kg and antimicrobiana activity in concentacoes between 6 100µg/mL (Bruno Bueno-Silva, Severino M.Alencar, Hyun Koo, Masaharu Ikegaki, Gil V. J.Silva, Marcelo H.Napimoga, and Pedro L.Rosalen, Anti-lnflammatory and Antimicrobial Evaluation of Neovestitol and Vestitol Isolated from Brazilian Red Propolis, J.Agric.Food Chem. 2013, V. 61, P. 4546-4550, dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf305468f).
The extracts of propolis red enriched with xantochimol and formononetina come in vitro presenting different activities antitumoral con ancestries of cells as melanoma using cellular ancestry B16F10, ATCC CRL6475 (Estela Maria Novak, Martha Silveira and Costa Silva, Maria Cristina Marcucci, Alexandra Christine Helena Frankland Sawaya, Begoha Gimenez-Cassina Lopez, Maria Angela Henriques Zanella Fortes, Ricardo Rodrigues Giorgi, Kamila Tamie Marumo, Rosangela Felipe Rodrigues, Durvanei Augusto Maria.Antitumoural activity of Brazilian red you propolish fraction enriched with xanthochymol and formononetin: An in vitro and in vivo study, Journal of Functional Foods, 1 1, (2014), 91 -102).
Etanolico Extract of propolis red comes presenting activity against cells of cancer of the ancestries of glioblastoma (SF-295), ovary (Ovcar-8) and of colon (HCT-1 16) (Izabel Cristina Gomes de Mendonca, Isabel Cristina Celerino de Moraes Porto, Ticiano Gomes of the Birth, Naiana Soares de Souza, Jose Marcos of Santos Oliveira, Rodolfo Elleson of Santos Arruda, Kristiana Cerqueira Mousinho, Aldenir Feitosa Dos Santos, Irinaldo Diniz Basilio-Junior, Abhishek Parolia, Francisco Stefanio Barreto, Brazilian red you propolish: phytochemical screening, antioxidant activity and effect against cancer cells, BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:357.DOI 10,1 186/s12906-015-0888-9).
Studies of proteomica identification of the cellular markers of larynx cancer had also demonstrated to activity of the laringeal extract of propolis red against ancestries of cells epidermoide front cepas ATCC Hep-2 (Caroline Olivieri da Silva Frozza, Tanara of Silva Ribeiro, Gabriela Gambato, Caroline Menti, Sidnei Moura, Paulo Marcos Pinto, Charley Christian Staats, Francine Ferreira Padilha, Karine Rech Begnini, Priscila Marques Moura de Leon, Sibele Borsuk, Lucielli Savegnago, Odir Dellagostin, Tiago Collares, Fabiana Kommling Seixas, Joao Antonio Pegas Henriques, Mariana Roesch-Ely, Proteomic analysis identifies differentially expressed proteins to after red you propolish treatment in Hep-2 cells, Food and Chemical Toxicology 63 (2014) 195-204).
In the whole world research exists to cure negligenciaveis diseases as the leishmaniasis and the extracts of propolis also come demonstrating activity against this parasitize.Duran et al. (201 1) (Duran, N., Muz, M., Culha, G., Duran, G., Ozer, B. 201 1.Antileishmanial analysis GC-MS and activities of two Turkish you propolish types.Parasitology research, 108, 95-105,) had shown leishmanicida activity for 2 types of extracts of propolis of Turkey (propolis Hatay and propolis Bursa) and demonstrated to a IC50 of 250µg/mL and 500µg/mL, respectively.Another important study for Duran et al. (2008) (Duran, G., Duran, N., Culha, G., Ozcan, B., Oztas, H., Ozer, B. 2008.In vitro antileishmanial activity of Adana you propolish samples on tropical Leishmania: preliminary study.Parasitology Research, 102, 1217-1225) disclosed good resulted for Adana Propolis against leishmania in concentrations of 250µg/mL.Another type of extract of propolis Turkish (propolis Kayseri) studied by Ozbilge et al. (2010) (Ozbilge, H., Kaya, E.G., Albayrak, S., Silici, S. 201 0.Anti-leishmanial activities of ethanolic extract of Kayseri you propolish.African Journal of Microbiology Research. 4, 556-560.) had demonstrated leishmanicida activity against the tropical Leishmania with IC50 of 32µg/mL.Comparative Study of extracts of propolis green Brazilian and Bulgarian extract of propolis accomplished by Machado et al. (2007) they had shown to activity against leishmanicidas 4 different species of Leishmania chagasi (amazonensis braziliensis and Major).Extract of propolis green Brazilian showed IC50 close to 49µg/mL against braziliensis species chagasi and Major, while the extract of propolis Bulgarian presented leishmanicida activity for the amazonensis species, chagasi and Major with IC50 between 2,8 µg/mL and 41 ^g/mL.Extract of propolis red Brazilian was evaluated in macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis, and demonstrated that the 25 concentration of ug/mL is capable to increase the reducing activity of active MTT Sendo against parasitizes intracellular presents in macrophages (Ayres, D.C., Marcucci, M.C., Giorgio, S. 2007.Effects of Brazilian you propolish on Leishmania amazonensis. 39 Memories Oswaldo Cruz Institute, 102, 215-220.).
The presence of some flavonoides and phenolic acids in extracts and dyes of you propolish show that these substances act sinergisticamente in cytotoxic citostatica action/, anti-inflammatory, cicatrizante, antimicrobiana and antirusty.In such a way, the combined substance cocktail party, exactly that in low concentrations, IRA to promote a powerful action against the pathogenic agents.The development and production of fitoterapicos and opoterapicos come Sendo regulated in the country with the resolutions that establish methodologies of quality control of these products.Studies of standardization of the fitoterapico and opoterapicos praise essays in order to guarantee the quality of these medication classes since the fitoquimico collection, screening, qualitative and quantitative determination of fitoquimicos markers, test of authenticity, processing, production, study of stability, validation of analytical methodologies, packages and quality control of product.
Due to its characteristics differentiated in terms of chemical composition and multiple biological activities, as well as presenting production characteristics and I cope standardized in the areas of manguezais of Alagoas-Brazil, respecting one politics of preservation and environmental conservation of the areas of Atlantic bush and manguezais, the production of you propolish red in natura and hidroalcoolico extract is part of a productive chain of opoterapicos products that promotes the sustainable development of the region of the fens and Sendo lagoons contemplated with the stamp of geographic indication with the denomination of origin.
Development of new systems of delivery of the medication or active substances on determined target therapeutical is a necessity to obtain the therapeutical success or that it demonstrates to physiological benefit to health in the prevention of diseases or cure of the same or still with esthetic action of and beauty, and she is TAO important how much short of molecules with determined therapeutical action.In such a way, in the present invention different dermocosmeticas compositions in the semissolida form of topical use or in the mucosae were planned, topical cutaneous and of release preferentially modified.
In the development of new systems of active extract release I contend some active substances with polimultifuncional activity in the dermocosmeticos becomes the necessary to have the knowledge of Pele as agency with function of barrier against chemical and physical agents, of the ways of permeacao and factors of penetration in Pele, as well as of the main cosmetic excipients responsible for the permeacao of these active substances in Pele and agencies attached.Pele functions as a great agency that recovers a surface better than 20 000 cm (2) with varied properties and functions, therefore beyond to protect the body of the invasion of microrganimos, protects against rays UV, produces melanina and immunoglobulins, beyond controlling the body temperature, pressure sanguine, as well as presenting sensorial function.The anatomic knowledge of Pele becomes the necessary in the choice of the systems of active extract encapsulation, as well as of cosmetic excipients that will go to compose a dermocosmetica composition.Pele possesses diverse histological layers, Sendo divided in corneal stratum, epidermis, subcutaneous derme and fabric adipose.The corneal stratum and pilosos follicles and glands (sudoripara and sebacea) are considered the first barriers that the speed of entrance of the active substances limits that composes one cremates cosmetic (Leon Lachman, Herbert A.Lieberman, Joseph L Kanig, Theory and Practice in Pharmaceutical Industry, Vol.II, chapter 18, pages 907-953, 2001).
In the dermocosmeticos, they are of extreme importance the choice of the encapsulating agents of the active extract and excipients used in multi-functional cosmetologia with properties, this is, excipients with diverse functions as: facilitadores of the cutaneous permeacao, fotoprotetora action, specific cosmetic action, estabilizantes of the hydrophilous system lipofilo/, control of sensorial viscosity and, beyond being biocompativeis and biodegradable.The cosmetic excipients are essential in a composition dermocosmeticas, therefore they present characteristics that assure stability to the composition, facilitate the administration, in such a way promote the release of active substances of the dermic matrix promoting the bioavailability of active substances in the different layers of Pele and consequently the pharmacological action adjusted SEM toxicidade, good with the acceptability of the consumer of the sensorial and esthetic point of view.For the development of systems semissolidos with application in cosmetologia it is the necessary to have a set of excipients that will go to liberate the medication adequately or active substances of a dermocosmetica matrix and amongst them are the excipients: absorbent water emulgentes, emollients, umectantes, bases, hydrophilous bases, oleaginosas, alcoois waxes, hydrocarbons, substances, fat acids, esters, poliois, insoluble dust, essences, preservatives, antiseptics.Some excipients used in compositions cosmeticas can modify the internal structure of the corneal stratum modifying the barrier function and increasing the speed of active substance permeacao for the corneal stratum, amongst them can cite: water, propilenoglicol, I acidify oleico, urea, DMSO, laurocapranos, pirrolidonas, and excessively tensoativos (Leon Lachman, Herbert A.Lieberman, Joseph L Kanig, Theory and Practice in Pharmaceutical Industry, Vol.II, chapter 18, pages 907-953, 2001).
Of the point of view of the process and the costs of production, farmacotecnicas incompatibilities are chemical they or physical, between active substances and cosmetic excipients they must be avoided.Some cosmetic excipients can generate negative influences for the dermocosmetica composition.The compositions cosmeticas due to presence of lipidic excipients, or for the lipidic active substance presence, are subject the reactions of auto-oxidation with posterior decomposition, Sendo an inconvenience for these formulations, resulting in unpleasant aroma and aspect and reactions of rancificacao.Therefore, the choice of the excipients must well be defined to avoid incompatibility problems medication excipient or excipient-excipient, reducing the stability of (s) the substance (s) active (s), in the composition, as well as toxicidade problems.Some active substances can highly be reactive a dermocosmetica composition and to produce chemical reactions of most diverse reducing the stability of these semissolidas compositions.Amongst the chemical reactions comumente foreseen they are the ester hydrolysis reactions, amides, imidas, lactona; reactions of oxidation due to presence of high concentration of oxygen in the composition and auto-oxidation; isomerizacao reactions; reactions of fotodegradacao initiated by the action of light causing the reduction of the power of active substances (Katsunori Yoshida, Tomoko Sekine, Fumiaki Matsuzaki, Toshio Yanaki (*), and Michihiro Yamaguchi.Stability of Vitamin in Oil-ln-Water- In-Oil-Type Multiple Emulsions.JAOCS, Vol. 76, in. 2 (1999) PP.6); reactions of degradation with toxic substance training as formaldehyde in the cosmetic composition and generating possible toxic effects as atopicas dermatitides in consumers of these products (Margareta Bergh, Kerstin Magnusson, J.Lars G.Nilsson and Ann-Therese Karlberg.Formation of formaldehyde and peroxides by to air oxidation of high purity polyoxyethylene surfactants.Contact Dermatitis, 1998, 39, 14-20).
In general extracts of propolis present in its composition diverse active substances of different fitoquimicas classes, namely: flavonoides, phenolic, terpenos, clerodanos acids, xantonas, benzofenonas amongst others, that can in contact with different dermocosmeticos excipients promote chemical reactions of most diverse reducing the power, the stability, beyond resulting in products with unpleasant aspect and still to result in toxic effects.In this direction, it makes the necessary to develop techniques of micron or nanoencapsulacao of active substances of natural origin.
Techniques of micron and nanoencapsulacao are used by industries pharmaceutical, nourishing and cosmetic with intention to solve technological gargalos amongst them: to protect (s) the substance (s) active (s) against extrinsic agents (humidity, light, oxygen) that they can cause hydrolysis reactions, fotodegradacao, oxidation; to prevent the loss of volatile substances; to increase the deadline of validity of the product; to promote controlled active substance release; as well as improving specific characteristics of active substance delivery in white fabrics.
Nanoparticulas, in general, is obtained by diverse techniques of preparation that amongst them we can cite the techniques of training of nanoemulsoes, and amongst them we can cite: method of double emulsificacao, emulsificacao-coacervation method, covering method with polymer, covering method layer for layer, method emulsificacao-diffusion and method of the nanoprecipitacao (Live, C. E.Fessi, H.Elaissari. the Polymer-based nanocapsules will be drug delivery.International Journal of Pharmaceutics 385 (2010) 1 13-142).
However these methods of attainment of nanoparticulas in suspension, if prepared of appropriate form they cannot present vanities as risk of microbiological contamination to be in watery way, degradation it polymer for hydrolysis, instability physicist-chemistry due to aggregation them particles or reduction of the biological activity them incorporated active substances.Some techniques of preparation of nanoparticulas avoid microbian contamination, problems of degradation of polymer and possible instabilidades; then the use of processes of drying of nanoparticulas is one of the resources to guarantee stability of substances for drawn out times.
Techniques of drying of nanoparticulas Exist, as the techniques of evaporation of solvent for rotaevaporador, drying spray to dryer, lyophilization and others.A method of choice for microencapsulated attainment of and nanoencapsulados very used is the method of drying for lyophilization.The lyophilization sufficiently is employed in the termolabeis substance drying, as material I contend proteinic substances, micro-organisms as used lactic bacteria in the production of yeasts, eatable fungi, amongst others., Also, method of encapsulation of material active sensitive to the temperature and high pressure is employed as.The drying of nanoparticulas presents advantages to increase deadline of active substance validity, avoids watery substance degradation in way and suspension, to facilitate to process of redispersao and reincorporation in semissolidos systems.
Until the present moment some documents in the state of the technique with potential of innovation for microencapsulation of propolis and few documents for nanoencapsulacao of propolis exist, however it was until now not identified documents in the state of the technique with nanoencapsulacao of the propolis red for dermocosmeticos ends.The documents to be followed will go to cite them.
Some documents in the state of the technique demonstrate the use of the lyophilization for attainment of microencapsulated.The pioneer patent KR1020030063053 produces granules of a mixture of 10 to 30% of propolis, 40 to 70% of lactose, 0.1 to 1.0% of vitamin and 10 to 30% of honey dehydrated by means of lyophilization.Chinese document CN171 1992 obtains microcapsules of propolis using in the composition excipient of high cost, the beta-ciclodextrina followed for lyophilization process.Already document JP2006028174 produces granules of propolis using an amino acid mixture in the ratio of 50% (extract of propolis: amino acid mixture).Microencapsulados of propolis I contend a modified starch (Octenil-succinato of starch) and Arabian gum was obtained by the technique of Spray (Silva F.C, Thomazini M., Alencar S. M. and Favaro-Trinity C.S., XVMth International Conference on Bioencapsulation, Groningen, Netherlands; September 24-26, 2009).The attainment of microencapsulated of propolis for diverse ends is described in the state of the technique.For example, the pioneer patent CN102920652 prepares microencapsulated of propolis with other biopolimeros: the quitosana, betaciclodextrina hidroxipropil and glicerofosfato of sodium for treatment of periodontais patologias.Pioneer Patent CN102772596 uses multimixture of extract of plant, propolis and 5% of quitina to obtain preparations using the technique of spray-dryer with application in the treatment of the obesity.Pioneer Patent CN102641256 obtains microencapsulated of propolis with urea, gelatin, paraffin, and toxic solvent (hexane) for preparation of microencapsulated with size of 70 great particle enters 150µιη.Document CN102429141 uses system gelatin/pectin and propolis for preparation of microcapsules of slow release using the lyophilization.
Process of attainment of components of the propolis in the dry state using gelatin I contend solution of propolis of the city of Maringa (Paran3a) were prepared by drying for spray-dryer.The otimizacao of the conditions of drying for spraying and the ratios of gelatin and manitol was researched (M. L.Bruschi, M. L. C.Cardoso, M. B.Lucchesi, M. P. D.Gremiao, International Journal of Pharmaceutics (2003) 264, 45-55).It Is fundamental to be highlighted that, the use of different types of excipients allows different mechanisms of release of active substances of the pharmaceutical matrix (microencapsulated), beyond different physiological actions.The Brazilian request of patent PI05001757 uses only two excipients (gelatin and manitol) and demonstrates only process of preparation of an intermediate matrix contends extracts of propolis not divulging the origin of the propolis used.The request of clear W3O 2014/186851 and BR 10 2012 013590-6 accomplished by our group of research and innovation with opoterapicos medication, with propolis in particular red, makes use of gelatin, starch daily pay-jold and colloidal silicon dioxide for preparation of microencapsulated of propolis red Brazilian with release gastroresistente.The request of patent French FR 725623 has as objective a multi-microparticulado galenico system of drawn out release of different active beginnings.These microcapsules are formed by a nucleus of active beginning, coated with a covering to the base for example of etilcelulose, polivinilpirrolidona, stearate and magnesium Castor-oil.European patent EP 548356 demands a multiparticulado tablet of fast disaggregation that understands an active substance in the form of microcrystals or of microgranules provided with a covering.Pioneer Patent W3O 2014/166994 A1 develops a mixing system of release of the active ingredient and understands a system particulado nano-micron that presents active ingredients in the interior of nanoparticula, as well as in the interior of the microparticle with application in compositions of verbal use.
Few products and nanotecnologicos processes of propolis preparation of nanoparticlas using have been developed in the entire world, for different groups of research, different ways and for different purposes (nutraceutica, therapeutical as well as cosmeceutica).A polimerica formulation of nanoparticulas of propolis (propolis nanoalimento) was developed using added micelares of reticulados copolymers and random of N-isopropilacrilamida (NIPAAm) with N-Vinyl-2-pirrolidona (VP) and polished (etilenoglicol) monoacrilato (PEG It) (Kim, Dong-Myung, Lee, Gee-Dong, Aum, Seung-Hyun, Kim, Ho-Jun, Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin, (2008) 31, 1704-1710).American Pioneer Patent 20130295181 US and patent EP2633862 of the same family of patent develops nanocapsulas of propolis the base of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), submicrometico size of particles (&lt;1000nm) understood between 220nm 438nm with different applicabilities and different areas: agronomica, pharmaceutical and cosmetic, etc.Family of pioneer patent WO/201 1 /001 181 and CA2765920 use extract of propolis to obtain a solid carreadora active substance matrix, specifically develop a solid film contend propolis.
Some examples show to the specific applicability in coated cosmetic area using nanoparticulas contend hydrophilic and/or oleofilicas substances in dermocosmeticas compositions, as well as in verbal compositions.Pioneer Patent WO2015/022471 A1 uses nanocapsulas of covering for oleofilicas substances active solar presents in filter UVA/UVB.Document KR20100078349 discloses to preparations of nano emulsions of propolis using β-ciclodextrina excipient.The document of clear W3O 2015/003155 A1 shows applicability of nanofibras biocompativeis contends quitosana, honey, acidifies ascetic, gelatin, colageno, alginatos, BSA and other formadores agents of reticuladas nanometricas nets and diverse natural or synthetic active substances con patologias as bacteria, arterial h(...)","EPNC

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention belongs to the field chemistry-pharmacist, more specifically to the area of natural products with utility to public health. They are proposed microencapsulados of propolis red (MPV), process of attainment of MPV, pharmaceutical compositions I contend MPV, process of attainment of pharmaceutical compositions I contend MPV and uses. The MPV production is on to the standardized hidroalcoolicas dye use of propolis red, followed for the technique of Spray, presenting itself in form of microparticles. Additionally, the asked for present deals with gastrorresistentes pharmaceutical compositions contends the said MPV. The MPV and the pharmaceutical compositions I contend the same present application in pharmaceutical industries, mainly due to its antimicrobianas activities.
BASES OF THE INVENTION
Propolis
Propolis is the generic name for a product natural of resinous, balsamic, gummy characteristics and highly adherent, harvested for bees (mellifera Apis). In the beehives, the propolis is used to close small openings, to embalm dead insects and to protect them against the invasion of insects and micro-organisms.
The collecting bees, by means of its back legs, collect vegetal resins of sprouts, fruits, flourish and exudates, that suffer addition from bee secretions. to be collected of some vegetal species, the propolis is a substance of highly changeable composition. This changeable composition depends on the geographic origin, in which the apiary is located and can vary due to the collection place, botanical origin I contend different species of medicinal plants, different times of the year and different geographic conditions including climatic zones.
The chemical constituents of the honey and the identified propolis come Sendo in the entire world (Pietta, P.; Gardana, C; Scaglianti, M.; Simonetti, P., Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, V. 45, P. 390-399, 2007). The flavonoides, phenolic and terpenos acids are the main substances found and used to track the quality and, in some cases, to demonstrate the authenticity of the propolis of some geographic regions (Volpi, N.; Bergonzini, G., Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis, V. 42, P. 354-361, 2006). Amongst the phenolic flavonoides and acids more comumente used as marking, they can be cited: quercetina, canferol, naringenina, crisina, pinocembrina, galangina (flavonoides); I acidify Gallic, I acidify cafeico, I acidify p-coumarico, I acidify ferulico, I acidify cinamicos and derivatives (I acidify phenolic), clerodanos (diterpenoides) (Rosalen, P. L; Castro. L; Cury, J., New Chemistry, V. 30, N. 07, 1512-1517, 2007); (Tomas- Barberan, F.; Martos, I. Cossentini, M.; Ferreres, F., J. Agric. Food Chem., V. 45, P. 28242829, 1997); (Yao, L; Jiang, Y.; Singanusong, R., Datta, N.; Raymont, K., Food Chemistry, V. 86, p.169-177, 2004); (Weston, R. J., Mitchell, K. R., Allen, K. L, Food Research International, V. 37, P. 166-174, 2004); (Mitamura, T.; Matsuno, T.; Sakamoto, S.; Maemura, M.; Kudo, H.; Suzuki, S.; Kuwa, K.; Yoshimura, S.; Sassa, S.; Nakayama, T.; Nagasawa, H., Anticancer Research, V. 16, N. 5 (a), P. 2669-2672, 1996).
Other markers are specific for the propolis green Brazilian as the isosakuranetina, bakarina, drupanina and Artepilina-C. Artepilina C comes demonstrating excellent anti-tumoral activity (Kimoto, T.; Koya-Miyata, S., Hymn, K.; Micallef, M.

H., Sforcin, J., Journal of Ethnopharmacology, V.83, P. 93-97, 2003) comes demonstrating the great therapeutical power of the propolis in substitution to conventional synthetic medication.
The characterization of all these biological activities associates to the trend of use of natural products has resulted in an increase of the demand of propolis and products I contend propolis, as extracts, tablets, capsules, atomization or after (Menezes et al., 1997).
Red Propolis
If treating to the propolis red, this was classified as 13° subtype of propolis Brazilian found in the regions of fens, lagoons, rivers and beaches northeast Brazilian enter the states of the Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraiba for the researcher Park and col. (2007). The main botanical origin of the propolis red if it must the Dalbergia plant ecastophyllum, locally known as Tail-of-Bugio, that it presents a liberated red resinous exudate of its sap. The propolis red can also be found in Cuba, in the provinces of Pinar Del Rio (There Coloma), Villa Clara (Manicaragua) and Matanzas (Great Jaguey) (Anna Lisa Piccinelli and col. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2005, 53, 9010-9016); (Osmany Cuesta- Rubio and col. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2007, 55, 7502-7509).
National and international Researchers with expertise in propolis come identifying the constituents of the propolis red. 11 was identified isoflavonoides and 1 chalcona of the propolis red Cuban and amongst these substances we can cite: Formononetina (Biochanina B), Bichanina, vestitol, orto-methyl vestitol, medicarpina, homopterocarpina, other pterocarpanos derivatives, liquiritigenina and isoliquiritigenina (chalcona) (Anna Piccinelli and col. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2005, 53, 9010-9016). Other subclasses of flavonoides were also identified, including new types of flavonoides of the propolis red of the northeast region and that we can cite: rutina, quercetina, luteolina, pinocembrina and formononetina, daidzeina, liquiritigenina, pinobanksina biochanina, the dalbergina one (neoflavonoides) (Park and col. eCAM (2008) 5 (4) 435-441).
Researchers studying the propolis red of the region of the manguezais of
Deodoro-Alagoas Marshal, had identified flavonoide crisina and quercetina, new isoflavonoides in the propolis red of Alagoas, vestitol, 2 (“) 4 (”) dihidroximetoxi flavana, benzofenonas isopreniladas, as well as I acidify ferulico and phenolic esters metoxieugenol, metileugenol, guiacol, dimetilicos esters of I acidify butanenodioico, methylic esters of I acidify hexadecanoico (Alencar and col. eCAM (2008) 5 (3) 313 - 316).
Additionally, researchers had identified 14 substances in the propolis red of the manguezais of Alagoas, amongst triterpenos them (cicloartenol, lupeol, elemicina, α-amirina and β-amirina), phenolic acids (anetol, eugenol and metileugenol), isoflavonoides (isosativan, medicarpina) (Vassya Bankova and col. eCAM (2006) 3 (2) 249-254).
With seen short of molecules and its therapeutical targets for cure of the diseases, the propolis red has been submitted the diverse studies detailed on its biological activities.
The presence of some flavonoides and phenolic acids in extracts and dyes of propolis shows that these substances act sinergisticamente in cytotoxic citostatica action/, anti-inflammatory, cicatrizante, antimicrobiana and antirusty. In such a way, the combined substance cocktail party, exactly that in low concentrations, IRA to promote a powerful action against the pathogenic agents.
Microencapsulamento
The development and production of fitoterapicos and opoterapicos come Sendo regulated in the country with the resolutions that establish methodologies of quality control of these products. Studies of standardization of the fitoterapico and opoterapicos praise essays in order to guarantee the quality of these medication classes since the fitoquimico collection, screening, qualitative determination and quantitative of fitoquimicos markers, test of authenticity, processing, production, study of stability, validation of analytical methodologies, packages it is quality control of product.
Development of new systems of delivery of the medication or functional food (nutraceutico) (Lira, C. R. G; et al., Rev. Bras. Farm., (2009) 90 (1): 45-49) in determined target therapeutical it is a necessity to obtain the therapeutical success or that it demonstrates physiological benefit to health in the prevention of diseases, and is TAO important how much short of molecules with determined therapeutical action. In such a way, in the present invention different formulations of pharmaceutical use, nutraceutico or veterinarian in the solid form of preferentially verbal use were planned.
In the development of new systems of release of medication or substances with functional activity (nutraceutico) it is of extreme importance the choice of the pharmaceutical excipients with inert properties (SEM pharmacological or therapeutical action), Sendo essential in nourishing a pharmaceutical composition/, therefore they present characteristics that assure stability to the composition, facilitate the administration, in such a way promote the release of active substances of the quimicofarmaceutica matrix promoting the bioavailability and consequently the pharmacological action, as well as acceptability for the consumer.
For the development of system of release of nutraceutico medication/in the solid form it is the necessary to have a set of excipients that will go adequately to liberate the medication or active substances of a pharmaceutical or nourishing matrix and amongst them are the excipients: diluentes, aglutinantes, disaggregating, colorings, flavorizantes, sweeteners, tensoativos or molhantes, fluidificantes and lubricants. Of the point of view of the process and the costs of production, farmacotecnicas incompatibilities between active substances and the excipients must be avoided. The choice and the number of excipients influence in the release of the medication of the matrix and in the absorption for biological fluids (blood and circulatory system). In such a way, the number of excipients must be reduced for the possible minimum and must only contains essential excipients (Croeley, 1999; Robertson, 1999).
Some pharmaceutical excipients can generate negative influences for the pharmaceutical or nutraceutica composition. The diluentes are in general the excipients that are used in bigger ratio in a composition and its choice must well be defined to avoid incompatibility problems medication-excipient or excipient excipient, will reduce the stability of (s) the substance (s) active (s), in the composition, as well as problems give toxicidade. Classic Examples are the diluentes manitol and sorbitol that it can reduce medication absorption, to reduce the intestinal peristaltismo, to provoke problems of hiperosmolaridade and hipersensibilidade (D. the Adkin, S. S. Davis, R. the Sparrow, P. D. Huckle, J. R. Wilding, Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 39 (1995) 381-387), (D. the Adkin, S. S. Davis, R. the Sparrow, P. D. Huckle, J. R. Wilding, J. Pharm. I Know. (1995) 84 1405-1409), (E. Jantratid, S. Prakongpan, J. B. Dressman, G.l. Amidon, H. E. Junginger, K. K Midha, D. M. Barends; Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, (2006) 95 974-984).
Techniques of microencapsulation are used by pharmaceutical and nourishing industries with intention to solve technological gargalos amongst them: to protect (s) the substance (s) active (s) against extrinsic agents (humidity, light, oxidation) increasing the deadline of validity of the product, to prevent the loss of volatile substances, to promote controlled active substance release, as well as improving specific characteristics of fluidity of after during specific processes of compression of compressed or in the stuffing of gelationosas capsules.
The development of microencapsulated solid can be obtained by the technique of Spray (drying for atomization) and can decide some industrial problems in the pharmaceutical area and nourishing due to insoluble nature of some medications or presence of complex matrices I contend diverse substances with different properties of solubilizacao that can make it difficult absorption processes consequently and therapeutical effect.
In the microencapsulation process the pharmaceutical excipients are chosen adequately to promote a steady covering wall in appropriate ratio that promotes the encapsulamento of substances of interest in an covering matrix formando, depending on the size of particles, the microparticles or even though nanoparticulas.
A polimerica formulation of nanoparticulas of propolis (propolis nanoalimentos) was developed using added micelares of copolir eros reticulados and random of N-isopropilacrilamida (NIPAAm) with N-Vinyl-2-pirrolidona (VP) and polished (etilenoglicol) monoacrilato (PEG It) (Kim, Dong-Myung, Lee, Gee-Dong, Aum, Seung-Hyun, Kim, Ho-Jun, Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin, (2008) 31, 1704-1710). It Is important to highlight that, the use of the matrical system proposed by Kim and collaborators, for training of the microencapsulated ones of propolis, presents as great vanity the high cost for acquisition of the excipients. In contraposition, the invention proposal in the present document, uses excipients of low cost, returning microencapsulated and the pharmaceutical compositions that use them more accessible products economically.
Chinese patent CN101869234 demonstrates the preparation of nanoemulsoes of propolis contends acetate of etila and tween. The preparation of microencapsulated using the matrical system of patent CN101869234 presents as great vanity the high toxicidade of acetate of etila, for human consumption. If ingested, the acetate of etila presents potential poisoning risk as losses of the direction, nauseas, vomits, diarrhea, giddiness and sleepiness.

Gremiao, International Journal of Pharmaceutics (2003) 264, 45-55). It Is fundamental to be highlighted that, the use of different types of excipients allows different mechanisms of release of active substances of the pharmaceutical matrix (microencapsulated), beyond different physiological actions. Some pharmaceutical excipients can generate negative influences for the pharmaceutical or nutraceutica composition. Classic Examples are the diluentes manitol and sorbitol that they can. to reduce medication absorption, to reduce the intestinal peristaltismo, to provoke problems of hiperosmolaridade and hipersensibilidade. In such a way, it is proven that, the proposed microencapsulated ones in the present document of patent present advantages destacada front to the state of the technique, for the use of excipients adjusted for the release of the constant active elements in the propolis.

Descriptive Report for pioneer patent: FLUORESCENT COMPOSITES POLIMERICOS FOR APPLICATION IN SOLAR CELLS, DISPOSITIVE ELETROCROMICOS AND EMITTING DIODES DE LUZ
Field of the Invention
The present invention consists of obtained fluorescent conducting polymer composites derived from pirrol and tiofeno from simple synthetic routes.It Also Deals With its processes of preparation and use of the same.These materials are derived from conducting polymers carrying a grouping electron donator-aceptor called dansila, can be n and p-doped and present eletrocromismo phenomenon, high efficiency of light emission, beyond being soluble in organic solvents, allowing the preparation of fine films that can be deposited on conducting substrata.The obtained materials can be used in organic emitting diodes of light (OLEDs), solar cells, dispositive eletrocromicos, sensors and several other technologies.Antecedents of the Invention and Previous Technique
The conjugated polymers come attracting much attention on the part of the academy and the industry, which had mainly to its electric, magnetic and optic properties, which allow to its application in organic optoeletronic devices [S.G.Robinson et al., J.Org.Chem. 2009, 74, 6606..The Yassar et al., Appl.Phys.Lett. 2002, 80, 4297].Currently, the majority of these devices is constructed from material inorganic semiconductors.However, the efforts in research and development of new materials are focused in the synthesis of material organic semiconductors (conjugated polymers) with the intention to return them competitive in terms of cost and durability in respect to the inorganic materials.
When compared with the inorganic materials, the conjugated polymers present as advantages the lightness and the possibility of manufacture of flexible devices.Moreover, it can be foreseen that, when the industrial manufacture on a large scale of devices constructed from conjugated organic polymers will be possible, these will be cheaper than current [the Y.Xu et al, Small. 2011, 7, 1338].
In such a way, the conjugated polymer design and synthesis new allow the attainment of materials with excellent characteristics for application in organic emitting diodes of light (OLEDs), transistors of organic effect of field (OFETs), organic solar cells (OSCs), eletrocromicos sensors and devices (ECDs).The polymers that can be applied in diverse areas are called materials multipurpose and are candidates in potential to diminish the costs of production of electronic devices based in organic materials [. the Balanet al., Chem.Commun. 2009, 6768.B.C.Thompson et al., J.Am.Chem.It Sounds. 2006, 128, 12714].
One of the properties most attractive of conjugated polymers is the ability to modify its electronic and spectral properties in function of the modification of the chemical structure, once the adjustment of the energy of Gap (Eg) of these polymers allows the variation of the wave lengths of absorption or emission [D.Baranet al., Chem.Mater. 2010, 22, 2978], or still of its electrochemical answer.The properties of conjugated polymers depend mainly on the electronic nature of departure monomer and can be proper for the modification of monomer from the introduction of different functional groups to its main structure, as, for example, the insertion of groups eletrodoadores and/or eletroretiradores, groups n-you doped or fluorescent [N.Atilganet al., React.Funct.Polym. 2010, 70, 244..The Cihaner and F.Algi, Electrochim.Minutes 2008, 54, 665.C.H.Lo et \., Synth.Met. 2006, 156, 256].For example, the introduction of fluorescent groups in the structure of monomer can return them appropriate for application in analytical OLEDs, ECDs and sensors.
Fluoroforo dansila presents in its molecular structure groups eletrodoadores and eletroreceptores, where the dimetilamino group acts as donator and the group sulfonila as aceptor.Moreover, the grouping dansila shows intense bands of absorption in the next ultraviolet region and the visible region with high quantum incomes.These characteristic, united the synthetic flexibility of the group sulfonila.faz of the grouping dansila a structure present key in fluorescent and marking sensors for metallic detention of cations and anions, as well as in supramolecular structures as dendrimeros [R.Metivier et al., J.Mater.Chem. 2005, 15, 2965.L.Prodi et al., Helv.Chim.Minutes 2001, 84, 690.L.Ding et al., J.Photochem.Photobiol.To 2007, 186, 143.C. - F.Chen and Q. - Y.Chen, Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45.3957.S. - Y.Liu et al., Tetrahedron: Asymm. 2005, 16, 1527.P.Ceroni et al., J.Organomet Chem.2004, 689, 4375].
A patentaria revision in the conjugated polymer area fluorescent showed that it very has a small number of patents describing the attainment and application of this class of materials.Toppare and collaborators [US2010/0249367] had deposited a patent in which they describe the polymer preparation conjugated based in benzotriazol with fluorescent characteristics, eletrocromicas and that n and p can be doped, beyond being soluble in organic solvents.In such a way, they had proposed the use of the derivative of benzotriazol in the technology of OLEDs and ECDs.
Generally the OLEDs are constructed using a conjugated polymer and an emitting layer (fluorescent) deposited on this polymer.The patents deposited for Fujiki and collaborators [JP20 0157471-A] and for Doo and Doo [KR2010 06090-A; KR 020108-B1] describe the preparation of screens (displays) in which deposit a layer of a conjugated polymer e, on this layer, deposit a fluorescent emitting layer.
The possibility of obtaining soluble fluorescent conducting polymers, with fluorescent characteristics and eletrocromicas properties, through simple synthetic routes is great a attractive one for its commercial use.The polymers obtained through the described methodology in this invention are of great interest since an only layer confers the inherent eletroatividade to conjugated polymers and the fluorescence that, in the majority of the cases, is only obtained from the deposition of a fluorescent layer, beyond the conducting layer.The present invention has as main advantages and aims:
· The route of synthesis of monomers and polymers simple when is compared with other routes of conjugated polymer preparation fluorescent, also because it does not need inorganic catalyser (generally to the base of NI or PDD), using only one selective abstrator of protons in the stage of esterificacao (protonsponge).
· Soluble polymer Preparation conducting, fluorescent, eletrocromicos and that they can be n and p-doped through simple synthetic routes;

Detailed Description of the Invention
The present invention understands fluorescent polimericos composites contends the group dansila, being able to be for use in OLEDs, solar, sensory organic cells, dispositive eletrocromicos and several other technologies.It Also Understands the preparation of monomers dansilglicinato of 3- (1 ' - pirrolill) propounds (DGPP) and dansilglicinato of 2- (3 ' - tienil one) etila (DGTE) and attainment of its respective polymers through oxidation with FeC in way of chloroform or through electrochemical polymerization.
The obtained monomers and polymers absorb light in an ample band of the specter and they also emit light in an ample band, having as resulted material soluble in organic solvents (diclorometano, acetone, chloroform, acetonitrila), that they present high efficiency of light emission, beyond being eletrocromicos when deposited in the form of fine films on substrata conducting and submitted the variation of electric potential.
The route of synthesis of fluorescent derivatives DGPP, DGTE and of its polymers is represented in Figures 1 and 2 and consists of three simple stages: a) Synthesis of the DGPP:
• Attainment of the 1- (3-bromopropil) pirrol from the 2,5 - dimetoxitetraidrofurano and of hidrobrometo of bromopropilamina in way I acidify (method of Clauson-Kaas);
• Nucleofilica Substitution of the 1- (3-bromopropil) pirrol with sodium iodide in acetone for training of the 1 - (3-iodopropilpirrol);
• Reaction of esterificacao between 1- (3-iodopropil) pirrol and dansilglicina using [1,8-encore (dimetilamino) naftaleno] (protonsponge®) as abstrator selective of protons, in acetonitrila
b) Synthesis of the DGTE:
• Conversion of the 2- (3-tienil) ethanol for 3- (2-bromoetil) tiofeno using PBr3;
• Nucleofilicado Substitution 3- (2-bromoetil) tiofeno with potassium iodide in acetone for training of the 3- (2-iodoetil) tiofeno;
• Reaction of esterificacao between 3- (2-iodoetil) pirrol and dansilglicina using
[1,8-encore (dimetilamino) naftaleno] (protonsponge®) as abstrator selective of protons in acetonitrila.
The stage of chemical polymerization is accomplished from the oxidation of monomers with ferric chloride (FeCI
) in chloroform (CH
CI).
The polymers can also be obtained through electrochemical oxidation on electrodes as glass carbon, same platinum or transparent electrodes (ITO - IndiumTin Oxide or FTO - FluorTin Oxide) in way of acetonitrila: dietileterato of trifluoreto of boron (BFEE) 4:1 (v: V).
Depending on employed fluorescent polymer it is possible to obtain blendes and/or copolymers with fluorescent characteristics from the mixture of these with other conducting polymers (for example, I polished it (3,4-etilenodioxitiofeno), PEDOT) or not conducting (for example, quitosana).Or still, it is possible to obtain fluorescent compositos from the mixture of these polymers with, for example, nanotubos of carbon, argilas you mine, among others.
The variation of the types of employed polymers also makes possible the diversity of colors, that can vary between brown with emission of light in the green color for the derivative of pirrol and orange yellow with emission of yellow light for the tiofeno derivative.Moreover, the tiofeno derivative presents prepared eletrocromismo when in the form of a deposited film fine on a conducting and submitted substratum to a variation of electric potential.In this in case that, the films are presented in the yellow color when in the neutral state (potential electric of 0,0 V) passing for the blue color the transparent one when in the state oxidated (potential electric above 0,5 V).A two more polymer Can also be made or mixture of to obtain intermediate colors.
The invention still deals with the preparation process of the fine films of deposited fluorescent polymers on conducting substrata, which understand the following stages:
i) Treatment of the surface of the electrode with subsequent washings of solutions of alkaline Extran® (Merck), distiled water and isopropilico alcohol;
ii) Preparation of a solution I contend varied ratios of fluorescent polymer (solid) in a organic solvent as diclorometano, acetone or methanol.
iii) Deposition on the conducting surface through dropcast (dripping on the surface), dipcoating (immersion of the substratum in the solution I contend fluorescent polymer) or still for spin coating (dripping of the solution under vacuum and rotation the constant speed).
After the evaporation of the solvent, the resulting material forms an adherent film the surface of the conducting substratum and can be characterized through usual espectroeletroquimicas techniques.The adherent films to the conducting surface can also be obtained from the electrochemical oxidation of monomers in a solution of acetonitrila contend a conducting salt (electrolyte, usually perclorato of lithium, tatrafluoroborato of tetrabutilamonio or any other known) and BFEE (one I acidify of Lewis) as catalytic of the oxidation reaction.All the process of deposition of polimericos films can be accomplished in ambient temperature.
The present invention still understands the use of monomers, polymers and its films in an ample gamma of applications, being able itself to cite: materials for used electrodes in the construction of eletrocromicos devices, solar, sensory organic cells and organic emitting diodes of light; screens and filters for laptops; displays; fotoluminescentes elements for fotodinamica therapy of the cancer; beepers in panels of industrial and household-electric machines; active elements of polimerico laser; lenses and prisms in general; lenses for glasses; viewfinders and panels for electro-electronic.
EXAMPLE 1:
Synthesis of dansilglicinatodo 3- (1 '- pirrolil one) propounds (DGPP)
The synthesis of the DGPP was accomplished as described to follow: the 1- (3 ' - iodopropil) pirrol (660 MG, 2,84 mmol) and the 1,8-encore (dimetilamino) naftaleno (proton sponge®, 440 MG, 2,09 mmol) were added to a solution of dansilglicinato (630 MG, 2,06 mmol) in 15 ml- of CH
CN dry. The reacional mixture was kept under agitation to 50 °C for 1.5 h and after that the precipitated formed white was removed by filtration. CH
CN (15 ml-) was added to the rude product, that again was kept under agitation. One more time the precipitated one formed was removed by filtration. The stage of filtration was repeated until not having more training of precipitated. 504 were obtained MG of a white solid (59% of income).
EXAMPLE 2:
Synthesis of dansilglicinatodo 2- (3 ' - tienil) etila (DGTE)
The DGTE was prepared using a similar experimental procedure to the described one in the synthesis of the DGPP.A yellowish white solid with 54% of income was obtained.
Chemical Polymerization of the DGPP and DGTE
The polymers were synthetized from the addition, drop the drop, of the monomer (DGPP or DGTE) (0,377 mmol) dissolved in 20 CHCI mL
dries, under atmosphere of N
, to a suspension of FeCI
(1,8 mmol) in 20 CHCI mL
dries. The mixture was kept under agitation for 48 h the ambient temperature. The polymer was precipitated from the addition of CH
OH, filtered and purificado in an extractor of Soxhlet with CH
OH. The polymer was dry under vacuum for 24 h.
EXAMPLE 3:
For the verification of the fluorescent and eletrocromicas properties of I polished it (DGTE) were prepared solutions of diclorometano with polymer in different concentrations and these sonicadas for complete dissolution.Fine Films dopolimero then were prepared by the method of dropcasting on transparent electrodes of ITO.
The specters of fluorescence (excitement and emission) of the polymer and monomer solutions were obtained in one espectrofluorimetroFluorologHoribaJobin Yvon, in atmosphere and ambient temperature.The registered specters of absorption simultaneously to the experiments of electrochemical characterization were acquired using one espectrofotometro of arrangement of Hewlett Packard diodes 8453A.The cyclical voltamogramas were registered in a potenciostato/galvanostato PGSTAT 30 of the Autolab.
The Figure 3 (and the B) show the specters of fluorescence (excitement and emission) of monomer and polymer in CH
CI
. As Much the monomer, as polymer, is fluorescent, with emission of green light (monomer) and turns yellow (polymer) in λ = 499 nm and λ= 547 nm, respectively, making of this material a potential candidate for application in OLEDs.
The process of doping n and p of polymer is shown in the presented cyclical voltamograma in Figure 4, in which the polymer deposited on ITO was ciciado in an electrolyte solution contends acetonitrila (CH
CN) and tetrafluoroborato of 0.1 tetrabutilamonio mol L (“1) using a platinum leaf as against electrode and Ag/Ag (+) in CH
CN as reference electrode. I polished It (DGTE) presents a pair redox in the cathodic region, related doping n of polymer, with potential of cathodic peak (Epc) in -1,039 V versus Ag/Ag (+) (CH3CN) and potential of anodic peak (Epa) in -1,030 V and another pair redox in the anodic region, related doping p of polymer, with Epa in 0,596 V and Epc in 0,483 V.
Figure 5 shows the specters of absorption of the film polished (DGTE) registered during the potential application.It Is possible to observe that the polymer presents absorption in the visible region, what returns possible the use of this material as active layer in solar cells or still in eletrocromicos devices.The espectroeletroquimica characterization of polymer in E = 0,0 V disclosed a maximum of absorption in 454 nm corresponding the transition ττ-ττ (*), whose energy of Gap (band Gap) was calculated in 2,72 eV.The polymer is yellow in the neutral state.
When the polymer is oxidated in potentials above 0,5 V versus Ag/Ag (+) (CH
CN) the absorption in 454 nm diminishes and a new band of absorption appears in close to 820 nm in 0,5 V due to training of the polaronica band, returning bluish polymer, above this potential, appears a new band in the region of the infra red next (above 1000 nm) indicating the training to characteristic bipolaronicas conducting polymer bands. This behavior sample that the polymer is an excellent candidate for application in eletrocromicos devices.
EXAMPLE 4:
For the verification of the properties of I polished it (DGPP) were prepared solutions of diclorometano with polymer in different concentrations and these sonicadas for complete dissolution.Fine Films of it then were prepared by the method of dropcasting on transparent electrodes of ITO.
Beyond this method, deposited fine films on ITO from the electrochemical polymerization of monomer DGPP were prepared. The deposition of the polimericos films was accomplished using one galvanostato/potenciostatoAutolab PGSTAT30. As reference electrode an electrode of Ag/Ag was used (+) (CH
CN) and as against-electrode was used a Platinum plate. The concentration of monomer was of 20 mmol L (“1) in an electrolyte supports constituted of a solution of 1,0 mol L (“1) of (C
H
) 4NBF4 in CH
CN/dietileterato of trifluoreto of boron (BFEE) 4:1 (v: V). The films of I polished (DGPP) were deposited through cyclical voltametria in the band of potential between 0,0 &lt; And &lt; 1,0 V versus. Ag/Ag+ with speed of sweepings (v) of 20 mV s (“1). In Figure 6 redox in the region between 0,2 and 0,4 is possible to observe the growth of the polimerico film on the surface of the electrode from the training of the pair V and subsequent increase of the chain in function of the number of applied voltametricos cycles to the system.
The specters of fluorescence (excitement and emission) of the solutions of polymer were obtained in one espectrofluorimetroFluorologHoribaJobin Yvon, in atmosphere and ambient temperature.The registered specters of absorption simultaneously to the experiments of electrochemical characterization were acquired using one espectrofotometro of arrangement of diodes Hewlett Packard 8453.
The Figure 7 (and the B) show the specters of fluorescence (excitement (1) and emission (2)) of the obtained polymer samples from chemical polymerization and the eletropolimerizacao on ITO. The specters were obtained from the samples in solution of CH
CI
in the case of obtained polymer way chemical synthesis and in solution of N-metilpirrolidona in the case of the electroplated material, since the films had been revealed insoluble in CH
CI
. The polymers obtained in such a way for saw chemistry as for nm for polymer obtained through chemical synthesis saw electrochemical is fluorescent with emission of green light in λ = 503 and with emission of blue light in λ = 480 nm for polymer obtained through electrochemical method. In the same way that in the case of I polished it (DGPP), this characteristic returns it a potential candidate for application in OLEDs, also for the possibility of attainment of emission in different regions of the specter, that is, in different colors, for exactly material one.
The process of doping p of polymer is shown in the presented cyclical voltamograma in the Figura8, in which the polymer deposited on ITO was ciciado in an electrolyte solution contends acetonitrila (CH
CN) and perclorato of lithium (LYCEAN
) 0.1 mol L (“1) using a platinum leaf as against electrode and Ag/Ag (+) in CH
CN as reference electrode. I polished It (DGPP) presents a badly definite pair redox in the anodic region with Epa in 0,167 V and 0,107 V, related doping p of polymer.","EPNC

Descrtitivo Report of the pioneer patent: INHIBITING COMPOSITION OF STEEL CORROSION CARBON WITH DISPERSED COMPOSITE USE HETEROCICLICOS MESOIONICOS IN MICROEMULSION OF OIL OF I SCRATCH SAPONIFICADO
Field of the Invention
The presented invention has as main field of performance the industrial operations and processes that use analogous steel carbon and in its equipment, ducts, reservoirs, etc, passiveis of chemical attack that provokes the corrosion. It Proposes the treatment of the resembled steel carbon and with the nitrogenadas substance use (heterociclos mesoionicos) solubilizadas in microemulsified systems, that act as inhibiting of corrosion. The invention understands a made up of type 1,3,4 - triazolio-2-tiol, whose structure it is below, a composition with mesoionicos heterociclicos composites in an microemulsion of oil of I scratch saponificado and its use. These composites present anticorrosive properties for steel carbon and been similar, presenting properties siner you hoist with the microemulsion.
Antecedents of the Invention and Previous Technique
Although the amplitude of problems caused for the phenomenon of the corrosion, the search for corrosion inhibiters, usually, has resulted in very specific systems for each in case that, considerando the complexities of the affected materials and the environments that surround them (generally in saw humid). Scientific literature and the bases of patents point with respect to a wide production of knowledge on the subject, with significant I focus in the solution of problems of corrosion in the processes related to construction (more than 8 thousand patents) and in the industry of the oil (more 17 thousand patents). Some collections especially are devoted to the study of the corrosion as, for example, the Shreir's Corrosion (Ed. T. J. Richardson, Elsevier, 2010). Old Patents already pointed with respect to the advantages of use of heterociclos nitrogenados in the corrosion inhibiter composition, as the case of Zisis and collaborators, who tell the use of pirazolios, imidazolio and 1,2,4 - triazois ones (US 3553101). The bronze corrosion also was inhibited with use of 3-azil-1,2,4-triazol (CN101914772). Recently, an increment of works and patents is noticed that make organic composite uses type occasion with ends of inhibition of corrosion in compositions of specific use, as, for example, Yoo and collaborators, who tell the inhibiter use based on imidazolina (KR2011026199). Uskach and col. they had developed an inhibiting composition for corrosion acidify I contend amino aromatical (RU2425858). Khusnitdinov and team had produced an inhibiting composition of corrosion acidify of steel contend derived anilinicos (RU2415970). Another Russian patent (RU2383658-C1) describes the use of urotropina and derivatives of polietilenopoliamina as inhibiting of corrosion in ducts submitted to high-temperature and pressures of I smelt it of well of oil extraction. Borisov (RU2379280) registers the use of derivatives of hidroxipropionatos for use in inhibition of corrosion in steel carbon in saline solution. The protection against the corrosion of copper for the water of the sea also was registered for Read and cols. (CN102115471 and CN102115891) with composite use triazol-tiol. Triazolicos Composites also were used in combination with sarcosinas and its you leave, in the inhibition of corrosion of the process of mechanical burnishing of parts (KR2011037997). Other derivatives of alquil-sarcosina, described as biodegradable, also were pautados as agents anticorrosion for addition in the mixture rinse acidify of materials of perforation of wells of gas and oil (US20110224111).
The microemulsion use to prevent incompatibilities between objects of extraction and fluid of perforation already was described, with use of species of chain of 1 to 10 carbons (US5762138). The removal of organic incrustations and you mine with microemulsion use of tiois esters/already was told (US20040092420). The microemulsion use based on propionatos, is combined with oil of scratches or with poliglucosideos, ducts and other components of the perforation of wells result in useful solutions for cleanliness of incrustations in (WO20061090 6). Already the microemulsion use with ecological appeal has ample gamma of use, having possibility of manufacture from derivatives of diesteres and modified hydrocarbons, Sendo indicated as special solutions of cleanliness for industrial processes (WO201 1 152872). The anticorrosive activity of the microemulsion of the oil I scratch saponificado was evidenced by the proponent group (Rossi, C. G. F. T., Scatena Jr, H, Maciel, MAM, Dantas, TNC, STUDY (') COMPARATIVE OF the EFFICIENCY OF the DIFENIL CA RBAZIDA AND OF the OIL OF I SCRATCH SAPONIFICADO MICROEMULSIFIED IN the INHIBITION OF the STEEL CORROSION CARBON, Quim. New, Vol. 30, In. 5, 1128-1132, 2007). Already the mesoionicos heterociclicos composite use 1,3,4-triazolio- 2-tiol with the described characteristics in this request, did not present previous register of the property of inhibition of corrosion in steel.

Summary of the Invention
The presented invention proposes the treatment of the resembled steel carbon and with the nitrogenadas substance use (heterociclos mesoionicos) solubilizadas in microemulsified systems, that act as inhibiting of corrosion. The invention understands a made up of the type 1,3,4-triazolio-2-tiol, a composition with mesoionicos heterociclicos composites in an microemulsion of oil of I scratch saponificado and its use. These composites present anticorrosive properties for resembled steel carbon and, presenting synergic properties with the microemulsion.
Detailed Description of the Invention
In this invention the synergic behavior for corrosion inhibition was characterized enters the microemulsion of the oil of scratches saponificado and the mesoionicos heterociclos derivatives of the triazolio. Three distinct mesoionicos composites (Ml) between itself due to presence of different functional groups were studied, in accordance with the structures of Figure 1. One of mesoionicos composites, MI-1, does not possess substitution in its ring of 6 members, whereas composition MI-2 possesses the group metoxi and composition MI-3 possesses the group niter.
() PREPARATION OF COMPOSITES MESOIONICOS
The used mesoionicos composites in this patent were prepared in accordance with the described methodology in Maciel (MACIEL, M. the M.; ECHEVARRIA.; RUMJANEK, V. M. acil-tiossemicarbazidas Isolation and characterization of as intermediate in the mesoionicos composite synthesis. New Chemistry, v. 21, P. 569-572, 1998). The chemical structures of solubilizados mesoionicos composites in the microemulsion of the oil of I scratch saponificado are presented in figure 5.
(B) PREPARATION OF THE OIL OF I SCRATCH SAPONIFICADO: the preparation of the oil of I scratch saponificado followed the de Rossi methodology et al (2007, op. cit). The oil of I scratch was saponificado by the dilution of 21,5 g of NaOH in 80 distiled water mL; in the sequence, this solution was added to the oil of scratches (100 g), followed of ethyl alcohol addition (300 mL). This reacional mixture was warm in reflux for 2 h. After removal of the alcohol, obtained soap (100 g) was dry to 40 °C.
(C) PREPARATION OF THE MICROEMULSION OF OIL OF I SCRATCH SAPONIFICADO (OCS): The preparation of the microemulsion followed the de Rossi methodology et al (2007, op. cit). A cotensoativo/tensoativo reason Was Used C/T = 1 (30%), where the OCS was the used tensoativo (15%), the butanol (15%, cotensoativo), the kerosene (10%, oily phase, FO) and the solution of NaCI [watery phase (FA), in the following concentrations: 0,5, 1,5 and 2.5%], the system was obtained ME (2 taxable income g) with region of work Winsor IV. For in such a way, she was titulou active substance (reason C/T) with the solution of NaCI (FA), until reaching viragem point S (solubilizacao point), characterized for a change in the physical aspect of the system, passing of I blur for limpid, or vice versa. After that, it obtained a point of titration (called of T) of composition known of the constituents of the mixture, inside of the single-phase region of the pseudoternary system. Point T is considered the titulante of the binary systems: FA + FO and C/T + FO. From a balance of masses the points were determined limits of the curves of solubility of the four regions of Winsor (I, II, III and IV), in the microemulsified system.
(D) IT PREPARES CA OF THE INHIBITING COMPOSITIONS: The mesoionicos composites were dissolved in microemulsion solution of oil of scratch saponificado, in the ratio of 0,01 to 2% (vol: vol), allowing the preparation of inhibiting systems concentrated with composition varying of 100 to 20000 ppm.
(E) TEST OF THE INHIBITION THE CORROSION FOR CHLORIDE: Solutions of sodium chloride work were prepared in water distiled in the 50000 concentrations of 1000 to ppm in chloride. Portions of the solutions with inhibiters, prepared in (d), were added to the solutions of sodium chloride work, in concentrations that had varied of 0,01 to 5.0% (vol.vol), on which were evaluated the anticorrosive power, comparing it with solutions you exempt of inhibiters, as much in the presence how much in the absence of the microemulsion of oil of I scratch saponificado. Such were used electrochemical techniques as linear polarization (pseudo-Tafel) and Electrochemical Impedance. The results had disclosed for superior efficiencies of inhibition of corrosion to 80%, in the critical concentrations for each mesoionico composition. All the tests were accomplished by the two electrochemical techniques, that had disclosed to the evident synergism of inhibition of composites Ml and of the microemulsion of oil of I scratch saponificado. PREFERENTIAL FORM OF THE INVENTION: Corrosion commercial the industrial inhibiter application/becomes through additives prepared in the form of solid mixtures or in solution suspension. In the case in question, one suggests that the marketing is accomplished through ready chemical preparations for final use as additive anticorrosive in the processes of neutral cleanliness (cases of organic or mineral incrustation). Also if it suggests the joint injection in fluid of perforation or completacao of oil wells and in the exploitation of geothermic energy, use in systems of closed circulation of watery solutions soft drinks in industrial systems, amongst others.
For such, she is suggested preparation of suspensions supplies, ready for marketing, contends of 100 to 20000 ppm of inhibiting type i, 3,4-triazolio-2-tiol in microemulsion of oil of scratches saponificado, respecting the maximum limits of solubility of each derivative. Depending on the interest concentrations of the final usufructuary, these suspensions supplies could half be diluted in the work solution/until formation a concentration of economically advantageous operation for each case. These suspensions storage are steady to the ambient temperature for some months, since kept protected from light, and they can directly be added to the interest system. The material can be storaged and be commercialized in bombonas plastic (bigger volumes) dark or resistant plastic bags (up to 2 liters). The material is atoxico considerando the characteristics recommended for final use.
EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 01: EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVITY OF INHIBITION OF CORROSION FOR THE INHIBITING MM FOR LINEAR POLARIZATION (PSEUDO-TAFEL).
An electrochemical cell of 3 electrodes, Sendo Was Used an electrode of reference of Ag/AgCI, a platinum electrode auxiliary and an electrode of confectioned steel work carbon SAE1020 (0,302 cm (2)), in a solution 10000 ppm in chloride. She Varied microemulsion concentration of oil of scratches saponificado (SEM presence of inhibiter), and observed a sudden effect of anodic displacement from the curve of polarization for more anodic potentials with addition of the microemulsion, as Figure first potential of corrosion (inset of the Figure) was dislocated in close to 100 mV. Such displacement discloses biggest protection of the eletrodica surface to the corrosion.
When adding mesoionico composition MI-1 in the constant ratio of 1/1000 with regard to the microemulsion, but keeping the same above described conditions experimental, was obtained as resulted the gradual displacement from the curve of polarization for more anodic potentials with the increase of the concentration of microemulsao/mesoionico, Sendo that the corrosion potentials were dislocated in more than 150 mV in the anodic direction in biggest concentration (Figure 2 and its inset). This result shows the significant increase of protection to the corrosion attributed to mesoionico MI-1 in synergy with the microemulsion. The corrosion efficiency was calculated as Sendo 42% for the microemulsion in the lowest concentration while for the ΜΙ-1/microemulsao in the highest concentration the efficiency reached 97%.
EXAMPLE 2: EVIDENCE OF INHIBITION EFFECTIVITY
OF CORROSION FOR INHIBITER MI-3 FOR IMPEDANCE
FARADAICA
Using analogous experimental system to the described one in Example 1 in a potenciostato with module of frequency analysis (FRA), one happened experiments of spectroscopy of faradaica impedance with use of 10 frequencies of KHz to 100 MHz and amplitude of 10 mV, in a logaritimica scale with 71 points per decade, in the region of the corrosion potential, becoming it deconvolucao of the real resistance with the imaginary one, in order to obtain the diagrams of Nyquist. Figure 3 presents the diagram of Nyquist for some microemulsion concentrations of oil of scratches in sodium chloride 10000 ppm. She Is Observed radical modification of behavior enters the pure chloride solution of sodium and the answers with the successive increase of the concentration of the microemulsion. The important increase of the imaginary resistance in the biggest microemulsion concentrations evidences a protection of the surface of the steel electrode carbon in respect to the corrosive attack of chloride.
Of another side, when adding mesoionico composition MI-3 to the microemulsion, obtained a maximization of this effect, conforms can will observe in Figure 4. Such modification of impedance specter was interpreted of quantitative form through the diagrams of Male goat and proposal of an equivalent electronic circuit, that had evidenced increase of efficiency of inhibition of 65% (microemulsion 0.1%) for 92% (ΜΙ-3/microemulsao 0.4%). The data presented in Examples 1 and 2, beyond other available experimental data with the authors, allow to evidence the effectivity of the inhibition of corrosion of the steel carbon for chloride in the presence of the microemulsion of oil of scratch, Sendo this effect substantially increased in the presence of mesoionicos inhibiters. Other experiments accomplished for the authors evidence that the three studied mesoionicos composites had presented inhibition efficiencies that had varied of 40 to 97%, depending on the concentration to micelar critical of microemulsion and on inhibiter. This study it allows the extrapolation of inhibiting efficiency for other mesoionicos derived from 1,3,4-triazolio-2-tiol, beyond will alert for the effective possibility of its preparation, since the described method for Maciel (Maciel, M. the M.; Echevarria.; Rmjanek, V. M, Isolation and Characterization of Acil- Tiosemicarbazidas As Intermediate in Synthesis Mesoionicos the Composite, New Chemistry, 21(5): 569-572, 1998) allow the preparation of a infinity of other analogous composites.
Biggest newness of this proposal is the evidence of the inhibiting effect of corrosion presented for researched composites 1,3,4-triazolio-2- tiol, with addition of synergic effect in respect to the evidenced inhibiting effect for the microemulsified oil system of scratches saponificado. As Much the inhibiting effect how much the synergic effect is considered unknown. It Must be stood out frequently that the inhibiting effect of corrosion observed in the critical concentrations sufficiently is raised, reaching superior values to 90%, what it denotes the potentiality of commercial application. Table 1 presents some critical concentrations of inhibition (bigger evidenced inhibiting effect), obtained for linear polarization (pseudo-tafel).

INTRODUCTION
The introduction has pretension to present the main target of the invention.Once the invention is unfolded in therapeutical applications for two types of parasatism and, still, in the composite development new with specific activity, they will be dedicated subs-section for each one of the subjects underlined here.
BASES OF THE TECHNIQUE
Disease of Ulcers and Leishmaniasis:
Close To three thousand people daily victims of neglected diseases die in the world as leishmaniasis, disease of Ulcers, malaria, and disease of sleep.They Are more than 1 million deaths per year, in accordance with data of the FINEP.This high number of deaths is reflective of the precariousness in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.The most affected for this recklessness they are the impoverished populations more of the developed countries less, and, therefore, not constituting a lucrative market for pharmaceutical industries.But 1.3% of medication made available between 1975 and 2004 they were for the neglected diseases, what it represents 21 medication, although to represent 12% of the global load of diseases.Graph 1 represents the Percentage of medication developed between 1975 and 2004.
In accordance with studies accomplished for the George Institute for International Health, the investments of private institutions in the area of neglected diseases correspond only 5% of the global resources for research and development (P&amp;D), sobrando for the philanthropic institutions (54%), and public (41%), that they do not obtain, most of the time, to give support to these investments along the years.
In Brazil, around R$ 75 million to the year come Sendo expense with governmental incentives for P&amp;D in neglected diseases, due to the incentives made for the Ministry of Science and Technology, by means of its two main agencies of encouragement: the CNPq and the FINEP.In 2008, they had invested more than R$ 25 million in projects of P&amp;D for the neglected diseases.
The disease of Ulcers, also known as tripanossomiase American, had as its finder the Brazilian researcher Carlos Chagas.It Is a parasitic disease caused by the infection of the hemoflagelado protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, whose triatomineos insects are its vectors.The forms most important of transmission of the disease of Ulcers still are the vectorial ones, that they are those on ones directly to the vector, to the transfusion of blood, the congenital way, and more recently, the ones that occur verbal way, for the contaminated food ingestion, the pricked one in the ocular or verbal mucosa, however also present importance epidemiologist the transfusional and congenital transmission.
Data of the OMS indicate the 16-18 existence million infected by the T. cruzi, amongst them, 12-14 million individuals in Latin America, Sendo still found individuals contaminated in countries of the Europe and North America, most of the time resulting of the migration of individuals infected in search of better conditions of life.It Enters more than the 120 species of insects vectors, 12 species of the subfamilia Triatominae, are most important for the human infection, due to its capacity of invasion and procreation inside of the houses.
0 diagnosis, as much in the acute phase how much in the chronic forms of the disease of Ulcers, it is accomplished by the detention of the parasite for parasitologicos methods (right-handers or indirect) and for the presence of antibodies in the serum, through sorologicos tests Sendo the most used the indirect imunofluorescencia (IFI), hemaglutinacao (HAI) and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Molecular tests Could also be accomplished, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) connected to the hybridization to molecular sounding leads, and the Western blot (WB), as confirmatory test in such a way in the acute phase as in the chronic forms of the disease.After the infection, the majority of the individuals presents assintomatica acute phase.Patients develop symptomatic forms of the chronic phase of the disease years, or same decades, after the acute phase of the infection in approximately 40% of the patients.
The chronic case can remain assintomatico during ten to twenty years.However, in this period, it parasitizes is if reproducing continuously in basses numbers, causing irreversible damages in agencies as the nervous system and the heart.Already the liver, to be capable of being rehabilitated, the problems are rare.The conseguencias could be observed one or two after decades of progression, with gradual appearance of dementia (3% of the initial cases), cardiomiopatia (in 30% of the cases), or dilatation of the digestive treatment (megaesofago or megacolon (6%), due to destruction of the inervacao and the muscular cells of these agencies, responsible for muscular its tonus.In the brain it has training of granulomas frequently.In this training the disease is frequently fatal, exactly with treatment, generally due to cardiomiopatia (cardiac insufficiency).However the treatment can increase the hope and quality of life.
1 - Disease of Ulcers the disease of Ulcers consists of its vast distribution, high indices of prevalence and gravity of evolution, one of the biggest health problems Public in countries of the southern cone of Americas (DAYS, 2001; REY, 2001).Tripanossomiase American, called disease of Ulcers, is one important resulting parasitic disease of the infection for the protozoan hemoflagelado parasite.The forms most important of transmission of the disease of Ulcers still are the vectorial ones (either it saw resulting injury of the perforated one, either for ocular or verbal mucosa), however present also importance epidemiologist the transfusional and congenital transmission (HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 2008).The disease is an endemic zoonose in 21 countries, with estimate of 16 to 18 million people infected for the Trypanosoma cruzi.The stage most important of transmission of the T. cruzi is accomplished by insects of the Reduviidae family, including the Panstrongylus species megistus, Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus.In Brazil, the transmitting T. infestans is known vulgarly as “barber”.
The cycle of life of the T. cruzi understands three main trainings or forms, endowed with distinct morphologic and biological characteristics: epimastigota (found in the digestive pipe of the vector), tripomastigota (found in the vector and the blood and intercellular space of the vertebrate host) and amastigota (found in the interior of cells of the vertebrate host) defined on the basis of the general form of the cell (spherical, pear-shaped, prolongated), in the relative position between the nucleus and cinetoplasto (previous, lateral and posterior) and in the way of the exit it scourge of the stock market to flagellate (central or lateral) (SOUZA, 1999).
The biological cycle of the T. cruzi in the invertebrate host is initiated when the blood of infected animals is ingested during the meal sanguine.When arriving at the stomach, the form tripomastigota changes gradually in rounded off forms, some with a long scourge glue to the body and others with a short scourge, called esferomastigotas and epimastigotas respectively.After that, you parasitize migrate for the intestine, where they are multiplied as forms epimastigotas.After, they migrate for the part most posterior, reaching the rectum, and change in tripomastigotas metaciclicos, that the excrementss and urine of the triatomineo are eliminated together with (SOUZA, 1999).The infection for the T. cruzi in the vertebrate host is initiated when you parasitize eliminated for the insect in the metaciclico form tripomastigota, the Pele or mucosae of the vertebrate is inoculated in.The way most common is the vectorial one, through the pricked one of the barber, who, during the process of ingestion of the blood, deposits its excrementss next to the place to the pricked one (SOUZA, 1999).
The disease of Ulcers can disclose of acute, indetermined and chronic form.The first symptoms of the acute phase if they present, generally, enter 7 to 10 days after the infection for parasitize.In the place of entrance of it parasitizes occurs an inflammatory process, not always visible.However, in infections for the ocular mucosa, is observed a characteristic signal of the acute phase of the disease of Ulcers, called signal of Roman who consists of the swelling of both eyelids of the infected eye (SNOWS, 2002).
The acute phase of the disease can last of one month to one year, being able the patient to develop for the chronic or indetermined phase.The indetermined phase is about a chronic phase with low parasitemia and high text of antibodies, assintomatica and SEM clinical manifestations.After the acute phase, the majority of the patients develops during one or two decades in this indetermined form, in which, even so it exists the active infection, practically does not have clinically demonstrable injuries and the agencies and systems meet preserved in its anatomy and its reserves functionary (DAYS, 2001).Close To a terco of the acute cases of the disease of Ulcers it develops for the chronic phase.The chronic phase of the disease in some cases follows the acute period immediately; in others, REY installs itself after a assintomatico break of changeable length (, 2001; BLACK, 2002).The chronic form of the disease of Ulcers is represented by diverse clinical forms, affecting one or more agencies of irreversible form, highlighting the cardiac modifications as the main ones.The chronic cardiopathy and the appearance of megas, megaesofago and megacolon, mainly, represent clinical forms of considerable gravity (SZAJNMAN et al., 2000; CAZZULO et al., 2001; MONCAYO, 2003).
The prevalence of the digestive or cardiac manifestations in the disease of Ulcers depends mainly on the endemic region.He Is common to find cases of megaesofago in the central region of Brazil, Sendo this rare manifestation in other areas.The cardiac form presents as main symptoms the arrhythmia (75,000 cases/year), the cardiac insufficiency and the tromboembolismo.The digestive manifestations occur for the commitment of the functions of the affected agency.In the case of megaesofago (45,000 cases/year), the increase of the diameter of the agency and modifications in the motilidade is observed, beyond epigastricas symptoms as pains, regurgitation and hipertrofia of the salivary glands.Megacolon (30,000 cases/year) presents as main characteristic the obstipacao of the agency, that can last weeks (WENDEL et al., 1992; MONCAYO, 2003).
2 - Leishmaniasis
The leishmaniasis is antropozoonoses considered big problems of public health, represents a complex of diseases with important clinical specter and diversity epidemiologist.
She Is Observed existence of three profiles epidemiologists: a) Wild - where the transmission in areas of primary vegetation occurs (zoonose of wild animals); b) Occupational or leisure - where the transmission is associated the disordered exploration of the forest and falling of trees of bushes for construction of roads, wooden extraction, development of farming activities, ecoturismo; (antropozoonose) and c) Agricultural or periurbana - in areas of settling (zoonose of residual bushes) or periurbana, where it had adaptation of the vector to the peridomicilio (zoonose of residual bushes and/or antropozoonose).
Protozoans of the Leishmania kind present two forms during its evolutionary cycle, amastigotas that they do not possess scourge free e are you parasitize preferentially intracellular obligatory of the mononuclear fagocitico system of vertebrate hosts, where divide for simple binary division and in the flagellated forms promastigotas that they are found in the digestive treatment of the invertebrate hosts.The forms promastigotas previously possess cinetoplasto to the free portion of the scourge, that has the same length of the body.Peculiar Others organelas in tripanossomatideos are glicosomas and megasomas, that the forms are found in both.Glicosomas compartimentalizam enzymes of the glicolitica way, whereas in eucariotos normally they are located in the cytoplasm.Megasomas corpusculos is rounded off with pH acidifies where they are located, amongst other enzymes, cisteino-proteinases and they are abundant in the forms amastigotas.This you parasitize belong to the Kinetoplastida order, Trypanosomatidae family and Leishmania kind.
The Leishmanias defer in the standards from development in the natural invertebrate hosts, what he was used of base for the revision proposal for Lainson and Shaw, allowing the division of the Leishmania kind in two groups: the Viannia subgenus and the Leishmania subgenus.The main species of the Viannia subgenus are distributed only in the New braziliensis World and are L., L. guyanensis, L. panamensis, Peruvian L., equatorensis L. naiffi, L. lainsoni, L. shawi, L. colombiensis, L.
The species of the Leishmania subgenus distrubuidas in the New World are L. amazonensis, Mexican L., L. chagasi L. venezuelensis, L. pifanoi, L. hertigi, L. enriettii, L. deanei, L. aristidei, L. garnhami, L. forattiniii, and the species of the Old World are L. donovani, tropical L., L. infantum, L. major, aethiopica L., turanica Arabian L. and L.The differentiation enters some species of Leishmania inside of a subgenus includes the morphology in optical and electronic microscopy, the behavior in the hosts, the identification for antibodies in such a way monoclonal as for isoenzimas and the analysis of DNA.The invertebrate hosts seem to be limited strictly the hematofagos insects.The dipteros of the Lutzomya kind are the vectors of transmission of Leishmanias in Americas and the dipteros of the Phlebotomus kind are involved with the transmission in the Old World.More than 20 species of Leishmania they have been identified as causing of diseases in humans and each one presents specific sources of infection.
The infection of the invertebrate host occurs when the female of the vector pricks a vertebrate infected during the meal sanguine and, together with the blood, it ingests parasitized macrophages.During the passage for the digestive treatment, the macrophages breach themselves liberating amastigotas that they change in promastigotas, still multiply in the ingested blood that is wrapped up for the peritrofica membrane secretada by the cells of the stomach of the insect.After the digestion of the blood, the peritrofica membrane if it breaches and the forms promastigotas stays free, is divided intensely and changes in promastigotas metaciclicas SEM the capacity of binary division, migrating then for the proboscida of the insect.With the proboscida blocked for the Leishmanias, the insect has difficulty of if feeding e, when it pricks, it regurgitates you parasitize for the interior of the Pele of the vertebrate host, inoculating them in the place of the pricked one, thus occurring the transmission.The inoculated flagellates are fagocitados by teciduais macrophages of the host formando, thus, vacuolo parasitoforo.Quickly promastigotas is differentiated in amastigotas and is multiplied in the interior of these vacuolos, until the macrophage breaches itself, liberating amastigotas in the fabric, Sendo fagocitadas again, initiating in the place a new intracellular cycle and causing, thus, the leishmaniasis.The parasites of the Leishmania kind determine diseases of the mononuclear system fagocitico that present clinical characteristics and diverse epidemiologists, therefore were gotten together in four groups (Table 1):
Table 1
· Cutaneous Leishmaniase - it produces exclusively limited cutaneous injuries.
Leishmaniase cutaneous-mucosa - frequently they are complicated for the appearance of destructive injuries in some mucosae.
Visceral Leishmaniase or Calazar - the parasite has tropismo for the mononuclear fagocitico system of agencies as the liver, the spleen and the marrow, that become hipertrofiados.
Diffuse cutaneous Leishmaniase - spread cutaneous forms.
The pentavalentes antimonial substances (Sb5+) have been used in the treatment of the human leishmaniasis since the beginning of century XX and continue Sendo the drugs of choice for the cutaneous and visceral disease.In 1937, the estibogluconato of sodium (, Pentostan®, one derived from I acidify it estibonico complexado to the Sb5+) was used, also for saw intramuscular, reducing the collateral effects and the toxicidade and in Brazil, currently, the used medication is the antimoniato of meglumina (B, Glucantime®).The mechanism of action of these composites is the inhibition of enzymes of the glicolitica way and the β-oxidation in amastigotas, but Sendo a weighed metal, acreditase that it interferes with other metabolic ways of the Leishmania, as well as with the one of the host.Also it was observed that they are capable to inhibit topoisomerase II of L. panamensis and of L. donovani.
Beyond the difficulties of administration and the high cost, the pentavalentes antimonial substances present important collateral effects that include myalgia, arthralgia, serico increase of hepatic enzymes, pancreatite, gastrintestinal dysfunction, diffuse muscular pains, enrijecimento of the joints, arrhythmias, pancitopenia, reversible renal insufficiency and cardiotoxicidade.The clinical cure is not accompanied of parasitologica cure, therefore they have been observed parasites in the scar of individuals clinically cured after treatment.The anfotericina B, the pentamidina, miltefosine and the paramomicina have been the alternative drugs in the cases of resistance to antimonial substances, but they do not possess favourable a therapeutical index TAO and they also present important adverse reactions.Table 2 summarizes the therapeutical options supra mentioned.

3.Treatment of the disease of Ulcers/Leishmaniasis and Development of new drugs
Drugs for the treatment of the disease of Ulcers are not of the interest of pharmaceutical industries, being in the root of the problem the high cost of the investments and the lack of a potential market and secure in the developing countries.In a general way, the development of a antiparasitaria chemotherapy occurs (i) for the establishment of active beginnings of plants used in the popular medicine, (ii) for the investigation of approved drugs already for the treatment of other diseases, once they already were submitted very costly the clinical essays, or, (iii) through the determination of target (s) specific (s) identified (s) in metabolic ways key for the parasite.
Recent Studies have allowed to the identification of potential targets in T. cruzi and that they include the metabolism of esterois, the DNA and different enzymes.Nifurtimox and benznidazol were introduced in the clinic in the treatment of the disease of Ulcers in the decades of 60-70, but currently only benznidazol if it finds available commercially in Brazil, although it will present serious collateral effects and will require administration for long periods of time under medical supervision.In the forms visceral and mucocutanea of leishmaniasis, the medicinal treatment is indicated mainly in the cases of incapacitantes or desfigurantes injuries.Some established therapeutical projects of general form in Antimonios, Anfotericina B, Paromomicina, Imunoterapia and Pentamida Exist.Cetoconazol and Itraconazol, among others, are also used.
3,1 Immune Answer in the infections caused for protozoans.
The protozoans are intracellular infectious agents who usually infect the host for long period of time, in virtue to possess mechanisms that allow them to escape of the aggressions mediated for the immune system.Already it was observed that the infections caused for protozoans do not reach all the parcel of the infected population, having the immune system a fundamental paper, hindering the multiplication and the dissemination it vector.Except that an immune depression occurs, where would be unchained an immunologic answer, these agents can remain in the host for all the life.
Some components of the innate immune answer can participate of the mechanism of defense against the protozoans, but these microorganisms escape of this defense.The Tripanosoma cruzi has the property to hinder activation it complement, since it is hidden with molecules of the host as the accelerating factor of the degradation (DAF).In the same way, the infectantes forms of Leishmania resist its action of the complement, even so invitro promastigotas of Leishmania are highly sensitive to the complement.The leishmanias are also susceptible to the action of neutrofilos, cells with great potential to produce hydrogen peroxide and IN, but that, when penetrating the host, infects the macrophages, getting rid of the attack of the neutrofilos.The adaptive answer against the protozoans after occurs the antigen presentation for macrophages and dendriticas cells, saw MHC class II for cells T.As other cells can be infected, and the macrophages and dendriticas cells also express MHC molecules class I, in the infections for protozoans it also has activation of cells TCD8+.Table 3 shows the immunologic mechanisms of defense against some protozoans of clinical importance.

The cellular immune answer in the defense against infections caused for protozoans Is fundamental.Although an immune answer deviated for maleficent the Th2 polar region either, because it increases the susceptibilidade to the infections and allows the multiplication and dissemination of the parasite, the concept of that a powerful protective Th1 answer either must be seen with caution.In several protozooses, is verified that the which aggravated immune answer is involved in the tecidual damage: in the disease of Ulcers it is mediated by cells CD4+ and CD8+; a massive production of TNF-α and IN, is observed in the patogenia of the cerebral malaria.Such facts confirm that a balanced performance of the immunologic system is very important for the containment of parasitizes SEM tecidual destruction, making with that, even so it can continue present, the infectante agent does not cause disease in the man.Patogenese of the diverse clinical forms of the leishmaniasis exemplifys the importance of the Th1 answer well in such a way in the control as in the genesis of the tecidual injury.After the inoculation of the Leishmania in Pele and macrofagica invasion, in the individuals that do not have the capacity to produce IFN-γ and will activate macrophages, the Leishmania spreads e, in the dependence of the species, cause the visceral leishmaniasis (L. chagasi) or the diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (L. amazonensis).Due to deficiency of IFN-y and high production of IL-10 the development of the disease occurs.The restoration of the immune answer in vitro in the visceral leishmaniasis can be observed by the neutralization of IL-10 or the addition of IL-12 to the mononuclear cultures of cells of peripheral blood (CMSP).
Already in the cutaneous leishmaniasis and the mucous leishmaniasis, where a strong Th1 deviation is observed and, even so the number of you parasitize in the fabric is scarce or until absentee, has injury development.CMSP of individuals with stimulated cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucous leishmaniasis with antigen of Leishmania produce large amount of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α, and little IL-10.As usually the immune system does not obtain to destroy the leishmanias completely, this strong Th1 answer finishes to take the occurrence of very intense an inflammatory reaction and the damage to proper fabrics, resulting in the appearance of you fester in Pele and the mucosa.The accentuated production of TNF-α Has important participation in this tecidual damage and of IN. the Evidences of that the cellular immune answer participates of the patogenia of the cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucous leishmaniasis it includes: 1) the precocious treatment of the infection does not hinder the appearance of the injury; 2) existence of strong inflammatory reaction in the fabric with increased expression of TNF it, IFN-γ and few parasites in the injury; 3) patient antimonial substance association with drug inhibiting of TNF-α cure with mucous leishmaniasis that is refractory to the treatment with antimonial substance.
3.2: Relation parasitize-host:
The cinetoplastideos are distinguished mainly from the other groups for the presence of cinetoplastos, a granule that contains DNA, “kDNA”.Such structure is located in the mitochondria, that is only in this group of organisms, and is associated with the base of the scourges.Trypanosomatidae possesses citosomas reduced or absent, feeding itself entirely for lesser absorption, and cinetoplastos that of other species.Normally it possesses complexes life cycles, that understand more than a host and with some morphologic stages.Most distinctive of these, it is the phase of Tripomastigota, whose scourge extends along the length of the cell and conectase the cellular membrane, formando a waving membrane.The diseases caused for the Trypanosomatidae include the disease of the sleep and the disease of Ulcers, caused for species of Trypanosoma, and the leishmaniasis, for species of Leishmania.
The complete sequence of the genome of cinetoplastideos T.brucei, T. cruzi and L. major, was published in 2005.As protozoans, Leishmania and Trypanosoma they have genomes relatively great of 25-55 Mb, the codification for 8-12,000 genes.The main characteristic is that its genomes exceptionally possess a high level of conservation between them, although a dear evolutionary divergence 2,500 years behind.In truth, Leishmania and Trypanosoma share close to 80 - 93% of its genes, and only one limited number of genes are species-specific.This is still more remarkable when if they compare the three species of Leishmania, that share more than 99% of its genes, so that only 5 genes are specific for L. major, L. infantum for brasiliensis 27 and 49 L.
3.3 The paper of peptidases in the biology of parasitizes and patogenese
All you parasitize must infect its host (s) to survive and to spread, and peptidases is component essentials in these processes.
Historically, peptidases is cited as proteases, and deeply is studied in parasitology per some decades.Peptidases allows that you parasitize perforate barriers cellular, tecidual and the protein degradation of the host for the feeding.Also they are used to manipulate the immune system of the host and to delude the immune answer.Moreover, peptidases you parasitize they are involved in the protein processing that makes modifications secondary and are used as marking of imunodiagnostico of infection.Tripanossomas and Leishnania contain an abundance of cisteina proteinases (CPs) that they are members of the superfamily of papaina.The enzymes with bigger activity were designated Type I CPs.A characteristic that distinguishes enzymes from type I of tripanossomatideos from other CPs of the superfamily of papaina, is the presence of a terminal extension carboxi-uncommon, the function of which still is unknown.In Mexican Leishmania this CPs Tipo I am coded for genes RPB, and has its maximum expression in the form amastigota of parasitizes that it lives in the macrophages of the host.
The CPs of the Trypanossoma cruzi generally are known by the common name (or synonymous cruzipaina and gp57/51) and are express in all the cycle of life of parasitize, even so are more abundantly express in the multiplication phase, especially in epimastigota.
The inhibiters of cruzipaina inside provoke change in the localization of the enzyme of the complex of Golgi, reducing in 70% the transport of this for the lisossomos.With the reduction of it catalyzes and digestion of this, has accumulation of cruzipaina in the interior of the cell, diminishing the mobility of the membranes of the complex of Golgi, resulting in peripheral distensions of its cisterns.Such modifications would provoke the death of parasitize.
Studies indicate that the catepsina, one present other cisteina-protease in Leishmania sp would have similar importance to the one of cruzipaina, in the cy(...)","EPNC

Descriptive Report of the Pioneer Patent for PRODUCTION PROCESS
OF SILICA PROCEEDING FROM THE BEACH SAND.
[001] The present invention deals with the production of precipitated [silicas] through an acidification method of a solution of alkaline metal silicate obtained of the beach sand.The silica is an inorganic polymer with general formula 2 [SiO] or [SiO] 2.nH 2 where, the block of construction of the silica is composed for tetrahedrons of 4 [SiO] Sendo these on tetrahedrons ones to the others for connections Itself -. the silica presents in its high surface amount of [silanois] groups (Itself - [OH]), what it returns the surface of this susceptible polymer some chemical reactions.Due to presence of the [silanois] groups the silica presents characteristics of one acidifies weak of [Brwsted]-Lowry, Sendo this fact the responsible for the reactivity of this material, beyond will confer to the silica a polarity that returns the surface of this material very efficient places of [adsorcao]. [002] The silica can be natural or synthetic, crystalline or amorphous.The synthetic [silicas] generally are prepared by two processes: the process in phase of vapor ([VPP]) and the process of liquid phase ([LPP]). In the process in vapor phase ([VPP]), the [pirogenica] silica dust is obtained by thermal decomposition of the tetrachloride of silicon ([SiCl] 4) or [tetrafluoreto] of silicon ([SiF] 4) in atmosphere of hydrogen and oxygen.Whereas in the process of liquid phase ([LPP]), the half [reacional], as the proper method says, is eliminates and not gaseous.The process in liquid phase, object of this patent is divided in some methods, of which the main ones are: the method sun - gel and the [acidulacao] of sodium watery silicate solution.The morphology of the synthetized [silicas] will depend on the conditions where the chemical reactions, hydrolysis and condensation, to occur and the form as the liquid phase will be removed, that is, of the process of drying ([LEGRAND], 1998; [VANSANT], 1995; [SCHICK], 2006). [003] Synthetic the silicon dioxide generally obtained by the reaction enters an alkaline metal silicate and one I acidify mineral is a product with a great industrial demand e, the use of this inorganic polymer occurs in vegetal oil refining. [adsorventes] in the [adsorcao] of gases and liquids, desiccative in electric machines, panels, electronic equipment, leather footwear, articles and medication, for protection against the harmful effects of the humidity, in the stabilization of beers and, recently, in the production of [biodiesel]. [004] Some patents already were deposited on processes of silica attainment through the acidification of a silicate solution.It is known, for example, patent [CN]101973554, that a method for the preparation deals with a silica material using a raw material proceeding from the biomass, the ash of rice rind.Patent [CN]102765725 deals with a process of silica attainment by means of a method where a [siloxano] composition with [alquilo] is used as raw material and urea.Patent [US]5419888 deals with the silica attainment through the acidification of a silicate solution with acidifies sulphuric (H 2 ONLY 4) and posterior washing for withdrawal of the excess of In 2 ONLY 4 of the obtained product.The [W]02014059466 patent deals with the synthesis of an absorbent to the silica base using material [silicioso] proceeding from mines as: land of [diatomaceas] (DE), mixing silicon oxide and another material as, for example, the aluminum, [argilas] as the [dolomita] and the [betonite]. In this process the [silicioso] material is mixed one acidifies mineral fort with controlled [pH] in 3 to 6 e, after the appropriate treatment the obtained product is used for removal of contaminants in residual waters.The [W]02014039437 patent, in accordance with another form of accomplishment, includes a process of training of a [estruturante] for water combination, [SiO] 2, In the 2 and a not stoichiometric amount of I acidify to form a silica mixture having a molar relation [In the 2]/[[S]10 2] of 0,02 to 0,14 e, after that, the drying of the silica mixture to form a [estruturante]. In this invention the authors propose the adjustment of the alkalinity of obtained product e, therefore, controlling the degree of neutralization of the mixture [SiO] 2, In the 2 with it I acidify mineral fort.In the [W]02014016302 patent, the invention mentions in one first aspect to a gel to the silica base with a restrained sensitive material, in particular, a sensitive material light, [pH] and/or temperature.The referred to gel to the silica base with a restrained sensitive material is obtained through the use of a precursor of Itself - N that has two groups at least amino, in which the [gelificacao] is accomplished in the presence of the sensitive material referred to one.The present invention says respect to the use of the referred to silica - gel with the restrained sensitive material in medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural [biossensores], foods and applications [cosmeticas]. In patent [US]20110315660, in general way, the invention deals with a method for the recycling of silica residues, residues produced from a silica attack in the [nanoporosos] carbon synthesis and this material is used as precursory for the [mesoporosa] silica preparation gel, spherical [microporous] or [silicas] zeolites.In patent [US]20130145964, this invention mentions a process to it for production of a silica sun material, biodegradable and/or absorbable.In patent [US]4427578, this invention a catalyser mentions to it to the amorphous silica base and a process for its production.The inventors propose with this invention to provide a catalyser for the synthesis gas conversion that highly understands a porous amorphous silica support, in which the support has a [monolayer] of silica deposited on it and are impregnated with a transition metal.Other inventions Exist innumerable that deal with this subject all having as main product the silica and the differential of the methodology proposal in this patent for the others, are in the fact of:
a) Not to have daily pay necessity - treatment of the precursory source. b) Precursory Source of low abundant cost and. c) Use of simple and economically viable reagents. d) Methodology of easy agreement and use. e) Relatively short Time of production. f) Low consumption of energy, compared the traditional processes of production. g) Product obtained with similar characteristics the commercial products. h) Obtained Product presents deriving proper chemical characteristics of the used precursory source. [005] The methodology object of this patent is characterized for the use of a natural silicon source, the beach sand, that possesses the particularity to have in its composition some electrolytes proceeding from the exhibition of this material to several leaves existing in the marine environment.The electrolyte presence, according to studies of [Mookerjee] and [Niyogi] (1975), points that in [pH] lesser that the 3,5 electrolytes present little influence on the condensation fee but, above this fee of [pH], the silica produced in these conditions starts to acquire one high negative load that, with the electrolyte presence, comes to diminish the repulsion between loads, what it results in a fast condensation, what means that the electrolyte presence raises the [pH]
of the beginning of the condensation of the silica.This effect becomes more visible in the presence of [cations] with lesser ionic ray what it makes with that the silica obtained for this methodology presents proper characteristics as, for example, a basicity bigger that the silica produced for other existing industrial processes, what it returns it propitious for use in processes where the presence of a silica is necessary that presents these characteristics as, for example, in processes of [adsorcao] of gases acids, where this characteristic is obtained through processes of impregnation or [funcionalizacao] having raised the time and the costs of production. [006] The present methodology innovates in the direction to use this source of SEM silicon no daily pay - chemical treatment and with a temperature relatively low compared with some industrial processes used to obtain the same material, beyond the use of reagents of low cost.The methodology developed in this patent follows the following steps: it collects of the sand of beach, [peneiramento] of the beach sand with commercial bolters. mixture of the beach sand with the alkaline hydroxide in defined stoichiometric reason, heating in oven muffle of the mixture in a band of temperature of 100.deg.C 500.deg.C, during close to 1 h to 5 h, filtration of the hot mixture, acidification of the soluble product with one I acidify inorganic of molar concentration of close to 1M 6M and drying in 120.deg.C heats during close to 6h 12h in a band of temperature of 50.deg.C. In Figure 01 the used methodology can be visualized, [007] After the attainment of the silica, the material was characterized through diverse techniques as: Spectroscopy of rays X for dispersion in energy - [EDX], [Adsorcao] of [N]2 for the method [BET], Spectroscopy in the region of the which Changed Infra-red Ray with of [Fourier] - [FTIR], [Difratometria] of rays X - [DRX], obtaining itself the results shown in Figures 02, 03 and 05.
result of the analysis of [EDX] presented in Table 01 (chemical Composition of the beach sand silica obtained for [EDX]), points the presence, in this product, proceeding from the beach sand, with close to 96%m [SiO] 2, and 3.9% m of [S]0 3, beyond the presence of some metal oxides in lesser amounts in the band of 0,05% m to 1.0% m

[009] The obtained data are similar to the precipitated [silicas] obtained by the process of acidification of a sodium silicate solution with inorganic acids, what sample that this obtained product of the beach sand presents similar characteristics to the [silicas] obtained for industrial processes, differentiating itself in the used silica source and the presented private properties. [010] The infra-red ray of the obtained product, shown in Figure 03, is in accordance with data of literature (Figure 04) and in the specters observes it presence of some characteristic bands of [SiO] 2 such as: a broad band enters 3750 cm -1 to 3000 cm -1, that hydrogen of [silanois] groups e is attributed to the stretching caused for the connections, also, to the [adsorvida] remaining water.She Still Presents two intense peaks related to the asymmetric stretchings of the [siloxanos] groups (v Itself - - Itself) in 1200 cm"" ""and 1100 cm -1, a band related to the stretching of the group [silanol] Itself - [OH] in 900 cm a -1 band in 920 cm"""", attributed to the symmetrical stretching of the [siloxanos] groups Itself - - Itself) and a band around 1650 cm -1 attributed to the angular vibrations of water molecules. [011] The result of [difratometria] of rays X obtained for the silica of the beach sand presents a diffuse band in 20 equal to 22, 5.deg., shown in Figure 05. This band is attributed to the amorphous silica and the enlargemet of the observed peak is associated with the structural mess of the material, although the [difratograma] to point so that great part of the material has a disordered structure and some [polimorfos] associates of the material to stay overlapping to the wide line of the amorphous silica, as this equal narrow peak in 20 more or less 27.deg., that it indicates the presence of other crystalline silica forms, as the quartz that it possesses more intense peaks in this region.These results are coherent with the literature and obtained results of [difratograma] in literature for commercial [silicas], Figure 06, where:
a) Silica [Colloidal] Ludox TM50 ([DuPont]) b) Silica Gel [Sylodent] 700 ([Grace]) c) Silica [Precipitated] Hi-Sil 190 ([PPG]) d) Silica [Pyrogenic] HDK N20 ([Warcker]) [012] the silica of the beach sand can be used in some industrial processes, having as the one of the main uses [adsorcao] of gases that present characteristics you acidify as, for example, the CO2. For this a [mesoporoso] material of family [M]41S was synthetized ([ALMCP]1) having as silica source the obtained material of the beach sand.For the synthesis of this material was used a methodology found in the literature, shown in Figure 07, and the characterization of this material was made through the analyses of [DRX], Infra-red Ray, [termogravimetricas] [adsorcao] of [N]2, analyses and was verified its capacity of CO2 [adsorcao] through a gravimetric test. [013] In the [difratograma] of the [MCM]-41 synthetized with the silica of the beach sand shown in Figure 08 three characteristic peaks are observed, one with one raised intensity, attributed to the line of reflection of plan (100) and two others with lesser intensity attributed to the reflections of plans (110) e (200) characteristic of the [mesoporosa] hexagonal structure, the parameters of net of the samples of [MCM]-41 can be observed in Table 03 (Parameters of the hexagonal arrangement of samples [MCM]-41 synthetized with beach sand).

[015] The result of the infra-red ray spectroscopy of the sample synthetized with silica of the beach sand (calcined and not calcined) and shown in the Figure
10. In these specters a broad band in 3400 cm -1 observed itself that the two bands in the band of 2924 cm -1 to 2856 cm -1 that they are attributed to the stretchings of connections C - H of groups [CH] 2 and [CH] 3 in the species is attributed to the stretching of the connection - H, of the [adsorvida] water and the [silanois] groups Itself [vibracionais] [OH], of [CTMA] + +, that it is not observed in sample [ALMCPI]-CAL, what is given credit to be resulted of the calcination process where had the removed one of the [direcionador]. Around 1600 cm -1 a band meets who can be attributed to the stretching of the connection - H of the water [adsorvida] in the surface of the sample, a band observed in 1484 cm -1 that she is referring to the asymmetric deformation of the group methyl in species [CH] 3 - N +, absentee in sample [ALMCP]1- WHITEWASH, and still a band in 1080 cm -1 has itself that she can be related to the vibrations of the [siloxanos] groups (Itself - - Itself). [016] The band in 1240 [cru]' is attributed to the asymmetric stretching of v (Itself) as well as the situated band in 960 cm -1 that she can be related of vibration v (Itself) of the present [silanois] groups in the material and, finally, has the bands in 800 cm -1 and 450 cm -1 related to the respective asymmetric and symmetrical stretchings of the connections., (Itself -0). These bands are typical of condensed silica, material that she forms the surface of this [mesoporoso] material. [017] Figure 11 brings the results of the [termogravimetrica] analysis of sample [ALMCPI]. In it the presence of three main events of loss of mass can be identified.The first event in the band of 28.deg.C 150.deg.C corresponds to the removal or [dessorcao] of water physically [adsorvida] in the pores or in the external surface of the material, the second loss of mass occurs for return of 150.deg.C 320.deg.C that it represents the decomposition of [direcionador] agent ([CTMABr]) e, finally, has an event that 600.deg.C occurs between 300.deg.C
correspondent to the residual decomposition of the [surfactante] and the condensation of the [silanois] groups. [018] The study of the CO2 [adsorcao] he was accomplished using a gravimetric method, obtaining isothermal it of Figure 12 and observes themselves characteristic of isotherm of type IV, typical of [mesoporosos] materials. where we have first one [adsorcao] in [monolayer] and later has the fulfilling of the [mesoporos] represented [peio] step in the band of 0,5 partial pressure of Bar to 1,5 Bar.
sample [ALMCP]1-CAL presented a BoA [adsorcao] capacity front to the carbon dioxide and the results of the tests of [adsorcao] of sample [ALMCP]1-CAL can be observed in Table 05 (Capacity of CO2 [adsorcao] of sample [ALMCPI]-CAL). Table

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[001] The present invention belongs to the field of milky products, more specifically to the powder endogenous milky yeasts stabilized for production of curdle cheese with nutritional food characteristic and functional, destined to the human feeding with I focus in prevention of diseases.A powder yeast is proposed milky endogenous stabilized (FLEPE) that will be used for industrial production of curdle cheese, compositions of milky yeasts contends [FLEPE], process of [FLEPE] attainment, compositions of curdle cheese I contend [FLEPE] and process of attainment of compositions of curdle cheese I contend [FLEPE]. The production of this [FLEPE] is on to the use of milky bacteria, the [Lactobacillus] calls [paracasei] sbs paracasei and [Lactobacillus] plantarum in specific mixture, that was produced by the techniques of Spray, as well as lyophilization using additive of protection against thermal tension.Additionally, the asked for present deals with milky compositions contends the said [FLEPE], specifically the cheeses curdles and process of attainment of the same.The powder endogenous milky yeast presents specific biological activities in the production of the curdle cheese that will go to supply sensorial characteristics, nutritional, functional adjusted to the milky product with application in the dairies for production of milky products, especially curdle cheese.
BASES OF THE INVENTION
[002] The production of the curdle cheese retraces has more than 150 years, with the arrival of the bovine cattle brought by the Portuguese. Originating northeast of Brazil, its name happens of the use of the natural curdle in its manufacture.North-eastern it is
the main ones between types of artisanal cheeses proven incorporated to the Regional culture, alimentary of the population of this being part of the habits region, beyond being a product of high nutritional value and gaining space in Southeast region ([SEBRAE]. Cheeses that come

[003] The curdle cheese is a popular product that is part of the culture of the northeast region of Brazil. Although its economic importance and great popularity in the northeast region, the artisanal manufacture of the curdle cheese in [queijarias] does not count on appropriate technology for the guarantee of its quality (LIMA, M. H. P. [et] there.Elaboration of curdle cheese I broke it of milk pasteurized and inoculated with [Streptococcus] thermophyllus And [Lactobacillus] bulgaricus: Biochemical and sensorial Aspects. Bulletin of the Center of research of Food processing, Curitiba, v. 16, N.
[jan]. ***/jun.1998). It does not exist
P
standardization of its common process, Sendo the use of not pasteurized raw milk, placing at risk the health of the consumer ([CAVALCANTE], J. F. M. [et] al.Processing of cheese Regional the curdle employing pasteurized milk and endogenous [latica] culture. it Search Science and Technology of Foods, [Campinas], v. 27, P. 205-214 [jan]. - sea. 2007.).
production is found, in its majority, small agricultural farms and/or small agricultural and urban [queijarias] ([CAVALCANTE], J. F. M. [et] al.Processing of cheese Regional the curdle employing pasteurized milk and endogenous [latica] culture. it Search Science and Technology of Foods, [Campinas], v. 27, P. 205-214 [jan]. - sea. 2007.). The generally artisanal process and from raw milk, needs to accompany the evolution of the techniques (LIMA, M. H. P. [et] al.Elaboration of curdle cheese I broke it of milk pasteurized and inoculated with [Streptococcus] thermophyllus E
[Lactobacillus] bulgaricus: Biochemical and sensorial Aspects. Bulletin of the Center of research of Food processing, Curitiba, v. 16, N. 1, P. 37-44, [jan]. ***/jun.1998) and if keep in vigor with the current laws, that the one praises that the curdle cheese must be produced from pasteurized milk (BRAZIL. Ministry of Agriculture, Cattle and Supplying. Normative Instruction [n] 30, of 26 of the June of 2001.It Approves and it officializes the Regulation Technician of Identity and Quality of Curdle Cheese. Official Gazette of the Brasilia, Federative Republic Of Brazil, 16 of June of 2001.Section 1.) and some researchers have told contamination of curdle cheeses produced of artisanal form in the northeast region (BRANCHES, B. C. S. Characterization and technological election of isolated lactic cultures of curdle cheese of the [alagoano] hinterland. 2009, 109 f. Dissertation (Master's Degree in Nutrition) - Federal University of [Alagoas]. College of Nutrition, [Maceio], 2009.), however some studies proves the great acceptance of the consumer for the curdle cheese produced from raw milk and a rejection of this product when produced from milk a pasteurized, as for the flavor, thus generating, great concern of public health ([ARAUJO], M. C. G. [et] al.Sensorial Analysis and test of acceptance of the curdle cheese produced with raw and pasteurized milk in the city of you Rape New. [Holos], [v].4, N. 25, 2009.).
[004] In Brazil, the use of [laticos] yeasts in products of industrialized dairies is common, since to take care of legislation in vigor are produced from pasteurized milk, and due to a reduction of [microbiota] natural, are added commercial yeasts, that guarantee the sanitary quality and the development of the [flavor] of product ([BROLAZO], 1 7. M. Election and use of producing lactic bacteria of [diacetil] in fermented milk. 2003. 98 f. Dissertation (Master's Degree in Genetics and Molecular Biology). Institute of Biology, State University of [Campinas], Sao Paulo, 2003.). However, this substitution of [microbiota] native results in a loss of typical characteristics of the Regional cheese.With this, one has searched to isolate and to select [cepas] that are part of [microbiota] present in the artisanal cheeses, with the aim of if to obtain initiating and associate [laticas] cultures, to elaborate [laticos] yeasts, specifically chemical preparations for addition to milk thermally destined treaty the production of cheeses ([MACEDO], B. C.; [TAVARES], T. G.; [MALCATA], F. X. [Influence] of native lactic acid [microbiological], [biochemical] bacterium [on] [and]*** sensory profiles of Serra da Estrela [cheese]. [Food] Microbiology.

[005] In function of the great consumption of this cheese, in some states northeast already a specific legislation for its production exists.Nationally, already it is established its identity and the requirements least of quality that will have to be fulfilled, by means of the Regulation Technician of Identity and Quality of Curdle Cheese (BRAZIL. Ministry of Agriculture, Cattle and Supplying. Normative Instruction [n] 30, of 26 of June of 2001.It Approves and it officializes the Regulation Technician of Identity and Quality of Curdle Cheese. Official Gazette of the Brasilia, Federative Republic Of Brazil, 16 of June of 2001.Section 1.), defining as a product obtained for coagulation of milk by means of the curdle or other appropriate enzymes coagulants, complemented or not for the action of milky bacteria selected, Sendo obligatory the pasteurized milk use.It Presents semihard, elastic consistency, compact texture, SEM [olhaduras] or with mechanical [olhaduras]. The color is uniform, yellowish white; the flavor is soft, slightly I acidify and salty; the odor, slightly I acidify, as of fresh curd and the rind is fine.
[006] Most of the time it is manufactured of artisanal form with raw milk, what sensorial characteristics peculiar and appreciated by the consumers confer it (OAK, J. D. G. [et] al.Bacteria you acidify [laticas] isolated of commercialized artisanal Curdle cheese in Fortress, CE. it Search of the Candido Tostes Institute, v. 60, N. 345, P. 221-224, [jul]. ***/ago., 2005.). Its technology of manufacture is that it defines [microbiota] predominant of cheeses ([BERESFORD], T.; WILLIAMS. the [The] microbiology of cheese ripening. [In]:
[FOX], P. F.; [McSWEENEY], P. L. H.; [COGAN], T. M.; [GUEENE], T. P. [Cheese] chemistry, [physics] and microbiology, 3 [ed]., [Amsterdam]: [Elsevier] Academic Press, [v].1, P. 287-292. 2004.), as well as the sensorial characteristics of the curdle cheese they vary in accordance with the place where it is produced (OAK, J. D. G. Characterization of [microbiota] latica isolated of cheese of produced artisanal curdle in Ceara and of its technological properties. 2007, 153 f.

[007] The [laticas] bacteria ([BAL]) are a group that has as main characteristic the production of I acidify [latico] for the fermentation of carbohydrates.They Are [Gram] positive, not [formadoras] of spores, [catalase] and [oxidases] negative and anaerobic physicians (SILVA, N.; [JUNQUEIRA], V. C.;
[SILVEIRA], N. F. the Manual one of methods of microbiological food analysis.Sao Paulo: [Varela]; 2007. 317 P.). They Grow in [anaerobiose] condition, however as they tolerate the oxygen, then they are known as [microerofilas] ([CARR], J. C.; [CHILL], D.; [MAIDA], N. [The] Lactic Acid Bacterium:
[literature] Survey. [Critical] Reviews in Microbiology, v. 28, N. 4, P. 281-370, 2002.). Originally the group of [latica] bacterium ([BAL]) [incluia] 4 sorts of great importance in foods: [Lactobacillus], [Leuconostoc], [Pediococcus] and [Streptococcus] (SILVA, N.; [JUNQUEIRA], V. C.; [SILVEIRA], N. F. the Manual one of methods of microbiological food analysis.Sao Paulo: [Varela]; 2007. 317 P.).
[008] Currently, the [laticas] bacteria are divided in the following sorts: [Aerococcus], [Carnobacterium], [Enterococcus], [Lactobacillus], [Lactococcus], [Leuconostoc], [Oenococcus], [Pediococcus], [Streptococcus], [Tretragenococcus], [Vagococcus] and [Weissella] ([AXELSSON], L. [Latic] acid bacterium:

WRIGHT. [lactic] acid bacterium: [functional] [microbiological] and [aspects], 3 [ed]., [New] York: [Maercel] Decker, [v].1, P. 1-63, 2004.) and still, according to [Fox] et there. (2000) ([FOX], P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]:
Aspen Pubiishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.), [Lactobacillus], [Lactococcus], [Streptococcus], [Enterococcus] and [Leucnostoc] are the 5 sorts of [BAL] more [comumente] found in cheeses.
[009] The [BAL] of different species are used in the production of the majority of the cheeses that use pasteurized milk, with the main aim to produce acidify Tactical e, in some cases, aromatical composites, mainly acidify ascetic, acetaldehyde and [diacetil] ([FOX],
P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]:
Aspen Publishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.). I acidify It [latico] in turn, produced for the [laticas] Bacteria ([BAL]), has as main functions, to promote the acidification of milk, to facilitate the process of expulsion of the serum and to prevent the development of undesirable bacteria in the cheese.The [laticas] cultures that initiate the production of I acidify [latico] in the production of cheeses are known as [Starter] Cultures ([FOX], P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]: Aspen Publishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.). This micron - organisms can still be divided, in accordance with its optimum temperature of growth, in [mesofilicos] and [termofilicos], which grow to 42 an optimum temperature of and .deg. C, respectively ([FOX], P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]: Aspen Publishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.).
[010) According To [Fox] et al. (2002) ([FOX], P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]: Aspen Publishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.), the [Lactobacillus] can also be divided in 3 groups based on the end item of its fermentation: [Heterofermentativos] [Termofilicos] homofermentativos, [Mesofilicos] heterofermentativos facultative and [Mesofilicos]. The first group, [Termofilicos] homofermentativos, use only [hexoses] as carbon source for production of I acidify [latico]., [Mesofilicos] heterofermentativos the second facultative, uses, beyond [hexoses], other carbon sources, Sendo capable to produce organic acids, CO2, [H]202 and alcohol. [Paracasei] Includes the [Lactobacillus], [Lactobacillus] plantarum and [Lactobacillus] I married, which that [comumente] they are not found in the [latico] yeast, however associates to the secondary fermentation.These [lactobacilos] are called [NSLAB] - [non] to starter acid lactic bacterium, generally found in artisanal [laticos] yeasts ([FOX], P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]: Aspen Publishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.); [BERESFORD], T.;
WILLIAMS. the [The] microbiology of cheese ripening. [In]: [FOX], P. F.; [McSWEENEY], P. L. H.; [COGAN], T. M.; [GUEENE], T. P. [Cheese] chemistry, [physics] and microbiology, 3 [ed].,
[Amsterdam]: [Elsevier] Academic Press, [v].1, 2004.). The third group is formed by the [Mesofilicos] heterofermentativos that P. 287-292. [Lactobacillus] uses, obligatorily, [hexoses] and [pentoses] as carbon source.In this enclosed group are [Lactobacillus] brevis and the [Lactobacillus] fermentum, which is also not found in the [latico] yeast ([FOX], P. F. [et] al.Fundamental [of] cheese science. [Gaithersburg]: Aspen Publishers, CAP. 5. P. 54-97, 2000.).
[011) The [BAL] beyond if to be sufficiently known for its use as culture [starters] in the production of products cheeses, yogurts and [laticos], butter as acidified milk, is also important commercially in the processing of [carneos] products, spirituous and vegetal drinks ([CARR], J. C.; [CHILL], D.; [MAIDA], N. [The] Lactic Acid Bacterium: [Literature] Survey. [Critical] Reviews in Microbiology, v. 28, N. 4, P. 281-370, 2002.). In its isolation and maintenance, the use of the way of culture agar [MRS]
or broth [MRS], originated acronym of the formulation developed for the [Man] researchers, [Rogosa] and [Sharpe] in 1960, has been sufficiently used due to its capacity adequately keeps a great variety of species of [laticas] bacteria ([CARR], J. C.; [CHILL], D.; [MAIDA], N. [The] Lactic Acid
Bacterium: [Literature] Survey. [Critical] Reviews in Microbiology, v. 28, N. 4, P. 281-370, 2002.).
(012] [Microbiota] associated to the maturation of the cheeses is very diverse, however it can conveniently [dividiz] them in two groups, the known initiating cultures as cultures [starters] and the micron - secondary organisms that are also called of associate cultures ([BERESFORD], T.;
WILLIAMS. the [The] microbiology of cheese ripening. [In]: [FOX], P. F.; [McSWEENEY], P. L. H.; [COGAN], T. M.; [GUEENE], T. P. [Cheese] chemistry, [physics] and microbiology, 3 [ed]., [Amsterdam]: [Elsevier] Academic Press, [v].1, P. 287-292. 2004.). The cultures [starters] are responsible first for the production of acidify during the elaboration of the cheese, and, therefore, they must produce I acidify sufficient quickly to reduce the [pH] of milk, that is, depending on the variety of the cheese, as basic rule, to reach [pH] < 5,3 in 6 hours to 30-37 .deg. C. Moreover, also [contribuem] for the maturation process, since its enzymes are involved in the process of [proteolise], [lipolise] and in the amino acid conversion in [flavorizantes] composites.These intracellular enzymes, in many initiating cultures, are liberated due to [autolise], related of the loss of the viability of the cultures, this event were reported initially in [Lactobacillus] ([BERESFORD], T.; WILLIAMS. the [The] microbiology of cheese ripening. [In]: [FOX], P. F.;
[McSWEENEY], P. L. H.; [COGAN], T. M.; [GUEENE], T. P. [Cheese] chemistry, [physics] and microbiology, 3 [ed]., [Amsterdam]:
[Elsevier] Academic Press, [v].1, P. 287-292. 2004.). The associate cultures can be defined as selected cultures of [laticas] bacteria or other microorganisms related with the maturation of the cheese, that are added together with the cultures [starters] (DRAKE, M.
.; [SWANSON], B. [review]. [Trends] 366-369, 1995;
G. [Reduced] and low-fat cheese technology: [in] Food Science and Technology, v. 6, P. DRAKE, M. [et] al. [Chemical] and sensory effects of the [Lactobacillus] adjunct in cheddar cheese [cheese]. [Food] Research International, v. 29, N. 3-4, P. 381-387, 1996). It does not have significant contribution in the production of I acidify ([BERESFORD], T. P. [et] al. [Recents] advances in cheese microbiology. [International] Dairy Journal, v. 11, N. 4-7, P. 259-274, [jul]., 2001.), however, has as objective main the improvement of the sensorial characteristics of the product (DRAKE, M.; [SWANSON], B. G. [Reduced] and low-fat cheese technology: [review]. [Trends] in Food Science and Technology, v. 6, P. 366-369, 1995; DRAKE, M. [et] al. [Chemical] and sensory effects of the [Lactobacillus] adjunct in cheddar cheese [cheese]. [Food] Research International, v. 29, N. 3-4, P. 381-387, 1996; [BERESFORD], T. P. [et] al. [Recents] advances in cheese microbiology. [International] Dairy Journal, v. 11, N. 4-7, P. 259-274, [jul]., 2001.).
[013] In many varieties of cheese, the action of the associate cultures contributed significantly to the specific characteristics of this variety ([BERESFORD], T. P. [et] al. [Recents] advances in cheese microbiology.

4-7, primary P. 259-274, groups, [iactic] bacterium - and [Leuconostoc] (2) (4) bacteria and [jul]., 2001.). including: (1) [Lactobacillus],
They Can be divided in [NSLAB] - [non] to starter acid Pediococcus, [Enterococcus]
[Propionicas] Bacteria, (3) [bolores] and leavens that are developed in the surface of cheeses ([BERESFORD], T.; WILLIAMS. the [The] microbiology of cheese ripening. [In]: [FOX], P. F.; [McSWEENEY], P. L. H.; [COGAN], T.
M.; [GUEENE], T. P. [Cheese] chemistry, [physics] and microbiology, 3 [ed]., [Amsterdam]: [Elsevier] Academic Press, [v].1, P. 287-292. 2004.).
[014] The [laticos] yeasts are a microbian preparation contend high numbers of cells of one or more sorts and species of [BAL] ([BERESFORD], T.; WILLIAMS. the [The] microbiology of cheese ripening. [In]: [FOX], P. F.; [McSWEENEY], P. L. H.; [COGAN], T. M.; [GUEENE], T. P. [Cheese] chemistry, [physics] and microbiology, 3 [ed]., [Amsterdam]: [Elsevier] Academic Press, [v].1, P. 287-292. 2004.). They are constituted by initiating and associate cultures ([BERESFORD], T. P. [et] al. [Recents] advances in cheese microbiology. [International] Dairy Journal, v. 11, N. 4-7, P. 259-274, [jul]., 2001), with the purpose of will promote the acidification, Sendo its main function, beyond being responsible for the training of flavor and aroma, as well as, the training of [olhaduras] in the cheeses (STOLEN, M. M. the Art and the Science of the Cheese. Sao Paulo: Globe, 1991).
[015] In Brazil, the use of milky yeasts in products of industrialized dairies is common, however to the measure that commercial the [laticos] yeasts more are spread out between the producers, due to superiority and efficiency of the ancestries that compose them, diminish on the other hand, the bacterial diversity, and make it difficult the isolation of the Brazilian typical ancestries, once, the majority of the yeasts are developed by multinational companies ([BROLAZO], E. M. Election and use of producing lactic bacteria of [diacetil] in fermented milk. 2003. 98 f. Dissertation (Master's Degree in Genetics and Molecular Biology). Institute of Biology, State University of [Campinas],
Sao Paulo, 2003.). According To Oak (2007) (OAK, J. D. G. Characterization of [microbiota] latica isolated of cheese of produced artisanal curdle in Ceara and of its technological properties. 2007, 153 f. Thesis (Doctorate in Food Technology) College of Engineering of Foods, State University of [Campinas]. [Campinas], 2007), the use of commercial [latico] yeast promotes a false standardization of the curdle cheese, therefore it does not recoup the typical sensorial characteristics incurred by the effect of the thermal treatment.
[016] To Know the composition of [microbiota] latica of the artisanal cheese and the technological properties of the [laticas] bacteria ([BAL]) isolated is of great importance when a yeast adjusted for the production of the curdle cheese searchs produced from pasteurized milk, considering that the artisanal cheeses present a typical and different, dependant population microbian of the region of origin of the milk and with its technology of manufacture (OAK, J. D. G. Characterization of [microbiota] latica isolated of cheese of produced artisanal curdle in Ceara and of its technological properties. 2007, 153 f. Thesis (Doctorate in Food Technology) - College of Engineering of Foods, State University of [Campinas]. [Campinas], 2007).
[017] In Brazil, artisanal cheeses are cultural references of the regional culinary arts and represent, many times, the main income for the small producer.Therefore, with intention to preserve such characteristics, researchers in different Brazilian regions, amongst them, [Alagoas], have isolated [laticas] bacteria of milk and artisanal curdle cheese with the aim to select micron - organisms of interest for the manufacture of milky products of quality (OAK, J. D. G. [et] al.Bacteria you acidify [laticas] isolated of commercialized artisanal Curdle cheese in Fortress, CE. it Search of the Candido Tostes Institute, v. 60, N. 345, P. 221-224, [jul]. ***/ago., 2005.); (OAK, J. D. G. Characterization of [microbiota] latica isolated of cheese of produced artisanal curdle in Ceara and of its technological properties. 2007, 153 f. Thesis (Doctorate in Food Technology) - College of Engineering of Foods, State University of [Campinas]. [Campinas], 2007); (BRANCHES, B. C. S.

[018] Oak (2007) (OAK, J. D. G. Characterization of [microbiota] latica isolated of cheese of produced artisanal curdle in Ceara and of its technological properties. 2007, 153 f. Thesis (Doctorate in Food Technology) - College of Engineering of Foods, State University of [Campinas]. [Campinas], 2007) it isolated 643 [BAL] from the produced artisanal curdle cheeses in Ceara, with the prevalence of the species of [Enterococcus] faecium, [Lactobacillus] paracasei subsp. [paracasei], [lactis] [Streptococcus] thermophilus and [Lactococcus] [subsp]. [Lactis].

[020] The development of powder milky yeast can be obtained by the technique of Spray (drying for atomization) and can decide some industrial problems in the nourishing area, as well as of milky products due to [labil] nature of proteins and present enzymes in the milky products that high concentration of these presents substances in its composition.Chinese Patent [CN]
102676388A uses the technique of spray-dryer for preparation and production of agent of [Lactobacillus] fermentation [plantarum] [cepa] [MA]2 using the following conditions: temperature of air inlet 150 .deg. C, speed of air flow 60 [mL]/h and agent of thermal protection the ingredients sadistic glutamate (2.0%), [mycose] (5.0%), lactose (5.0%) and skim milk (10%). Pioneer Patent US 2014/014727A1 describes the use of method of drying for spray-dryer of [cepas] of [lactobacilus] in the following conditions: temperature of air inlet 140.deg.C, temperature of exit 86.deg.C, speed of air flow 500 [L]/h and agent of thermal protection only one solution sodium chloride to 10%. American Patent US
3222193 use the technique of spray-dryer for drying of nourishing products band of temperature between 120 .deg. C and 130.deg.C. American Patent of number US 2956885 demonstrated to the use of the technique of spray-dryer for drying of cheese of the BAKER type using temperature of entrance between 117.deg.C 126.deg.C and temperature of exit between 58.deg.C and 62.deg.C, however [paracasei] was not described drying of biological yeast using the [cepas] of [Lactobacillus] [sbs] paracasei and TAO little of the [Lactobacillus] plantarum.Patent [W]02012/007590A1 describes method of drying for cells of [eucariotos] of [cerevisiea] the [Saccharomyces] sort [aditivados] of serum of milk and derivatives using temperature of 189 entrance of .deg. C and temperature of exit of 89.deg.C. Patent [EP] 1281752 does not make the claim of clear form the drying conditions citing only the temperature of air inlet between 5 - 150 .deg. C, however it does not describe the temperature of air exit, demonstrating descriptive insufficiency in the claim.Until now [sbs] was not described in the patent revision the same conditions of drying for spray-dryer established for the cultures of [Lactobacillus] paracasei [paracasei] and component [Lactobacillus] plantarum of stabilized the powder endogenous milky yeast (FLEPE) for production of cheese Regional curdle of the [alagoano] hinterland.
[021] Another method of choice of attainment of the milky yeasts and very used is the method of drying for lyophilization.The lyophilization is, sufficiently, employed in the [termolabeis] substance drying.It Is, also, employed as method of attainment of nourishing products and in particular the yeasts in a general way.
[022] The attainment of yeasts is described in diverse documents, however some specific ones will be cited in order to show in priority research that the present invention is about an unknown research with its innovations for production of powder endogenous milky yeast for production of a particular type of Brazilian artisanal cheese and Regional northeast, the cheese type curdle.
[023] Some developed products involve an invention field as the nourishing masses, citing the patent PI 03094332A where the composition of dry yeast involves the yeast use the base of [Saccharomyces] cerevisiae in the area of farinaceous for production of masses for bakery.American Patent of number US 4085228 involves the cheese pizza preparation [mussarela] using a gamma of described milky bacteria as [Pediococcus] cerevisae, [Lactobacillus] plantarum, [Streptococcus] faecalis, [Streptococcus] durans, [Lactobacilus] I married that they improve the characteristics of fusion, taste and color of the cheese in the pizza.Pioneer Patent PI 07011580A2 develops a biological, called yeast of [Saccharomyces] cerevisiae enriched with enzymes [fosfolipases], [hemicelulases], glucose [oxidases], [amiloglucosidases] and [maltogenica] amylase for preparation of masses in the industry of bread making for production of masses and pizzas.Pioneer Patent PI 06113320A2 develops a milky yeast of a mutant [cepa] of milky bacterium for fermented drink production, including fermented milk [infantis]. Pioneer Patent [EP]0191513A
it demonstrates to the application of combination of some [Saccharomyces] micro-organisms [cerevisiae], [Kluyveromyces] lactis, [Candida] and [Torula] for production of a perfuming yeast applied in the production of diverse nourishing products, including fermented milk and fermented drinks and soft drinks.Pioneer Patent [W]02014/140115 describes the application of the use of [Lactobacillus] plantarum as preservative of foods.Pioneer Patent [EP] 2061334 demonstrates respectively that the agreed use of initiating and associate milky bacteria of the [lactis] type [kluyveromyces] and [propionibacterium] freudenreichii can be used to supply [flavor]/aroma of cheeses and to inhibit or to control growth of pathogenic bacteria.US and Pioneer Patents [W]002/18542

Descriptive Report for pioneer patent: ""COMPOSITION WITH ACTIVITY
[FEROMONAL] AND ITS USE IN THE CONTROL OF THE DRILL OF FRUITS OF
[ANONACEAS]""
Field of the Invention
[1] The present invention mentions formulations to it with activity of sexual [feromonio], effective in the control of the drill of fruits ([Cerconota] anonella) of [anonaceas] (pine cone, [graviola] and [atemoia]), considered one of most serious, for the expressive damages that cause to the culture.In one first [concretiz], v; to, the composition of the referred to formulation understands: (a) the combination of (Z) - 9-octadecanoa of [metila], [enal], (Z) - 9-octadecenol e, (b) an agriculturally acceptable vehicle.The reason enters such components in the compositions of the invention is, preferentially, of 1:3: 5, respectively.The present invention also mentions to the method of control of this drill through [utili]! - 1:1,) of the formulation of this invention.Such application includes the agriculture sector [pnciundo] to act in different regions where the culture of these fruits this Sendo spread.
[2] The present invention considers to decide the problem faced for the producers of [anonaceas] as for the attack for the plague in question, which comes causing serious damages in the commercial production of these fruits.
Antecedents of the Invention and Previous Technique
[3] Some [fitossanitarios] problems, especially the plagues, come discouraging the establishment them [plantios] advertisings of [anonaceas] (pine cone, gr. [iola] and [atemoia]), highlighting it [Cerconota] drill-pity-fr [anonella], considered one more serious them, for the expressive damages that cause to the culture.When attacked for this insect, the fruits [a]' ntan decomposition of the pulp and the attacked part becomes hardened and blackish, to reduce r its value commercial, or same, returning them improper for the marketing or the industrial processing.They Exist estimative of that in each harvest the loss of commercial pulp of [graviola] can reach percentages of up to 100%, due to the [massal] attack of this
[4] The point of view of importance of the culture of the [anonaceas], it is valid to stand out that it is not only the amount of the produced food that interests, but the product quality also harvested is important.The biological quality of foods is reflected in its nutrients and two important aspects must be considered by agriculture: the production of healthy plants and the attainment of potentially harmful chemical agent SEM foods to the man and the environment., Damages Thus caused for diverse diseases and a complex of plagues on the [anonaceas], directly influence in its marketing and production ([ARAUJO], J. F. 2007. [Organomineral] Fertilization and liquid [biofertilizacao] in the production of fruits of pine cone ([squamosa] Soursop L.) in the [submedio] San Francisco. Dissertation (Doctorate in Agronomy) - Department of Agronomic Sciences, Sao Paulo State University, [Botucatu], Brazil, 115p.). Moreover, in the control of such plagues, the pesticide use more and more tends to be reduced due to the environmental impact that such substances already had caused and continues causing.Restrictions to its use have been extended in all the countries, especially from the end of the last century.
[5] The drill of fruit C. [anonella] can be found in countries of Latin America, mainly in Venezuela. In Brazil one meets spread sufficiently, already having been evidenced its occurrence in the states of Sao Paulo, Amazon, Par3a, [Pernambuco], Bahia, will Dine, Mato Grosso, Rio de Janeiro, [Alagoas] and Federal District ([BRAGA]-SOBRINHO, R. 2010. Potential of exploration of the [anonaceas] north-eastern of Brazil. [Embrapa] Tropical [Agroindustria], Fortress, Brazil, 18p.).
[6] Until the present moment, the studies lead with this plague are restricted the description of the biology and the reproductive behavior of this species (SILVA, E. L., OAK, C. M., OF the BIRTH, R. R., [MENDON]ÇA. the L., SILVA, C. E., [GOL]ÇALVES, G. B., FREITAS, M. R. T., SANTANA. E. G. 2006. [Behavior] Reproductive [of] the Anonna fruit to borer Cerconota anonella. [Ethology], 112:971-976). In analogous way to other species of lepidopterons, the communication between males and females of C. [anonella] is mediated by [feromonios] and the perception of these signals for the males unchains a series of behaviors that is express in a sequence standard.This sequence includes the movement of the antennas, to walk, to vibrate the wings, to raise [voo], to fly in zigzag, to locate the track, to fly against the wind following the [feromonio] track, to locate the [feromonio] source, to settle in this source or adjacent areas, to walk and to put into motion the wings until finding the female.This is the chain of answers to the long distance.
meeting with the female initiates another chain of answers, of short distance, where the male interacts with the female and, possibly, he can lead to the copula (LIMA, E. R., [DELLA] LUCIA, T. M. C. Biodynamics of [feromonios]. 2001. [In]: [Feromonios] of insects: Biology, chemistry and employment in I cope it integrated of plagues. [VILELA], E. F., [DELLA] LUCIA, T. M. C. 2 [ed]. [Holos], Lush, Minas Gerais, Brazil, PP 13-25.
[7] The indiscriminate use of [agrotoxicos] still is the method more used by the producers, being able to bring risks for the workers and consumers, beyond causing environmental damages.An alternative practice is the [ensacamento] of the still small fruits, with the purpose to hinder the attack of plagues.This system is laborious and little productive.Of this form, the search of new methods for control of the plagues becomes necessary, as the use of [feromonio], object of this invention.
[8] In general way, [estudf] of the [feromonios] of insect plague is motivated mainly because of the economic damages, [caus] of the ones for the insects, which generally are accompanied by the environmental damages and of public health, caused for the use of chemical products of action pesticide.Therefore this search is boxed in at the beginning of Integrated Manejo of Pragas ([MIP]) that it can be defined as a system of I cope of plagues that associate the environment and the population dynamics of the species, using all the appropriate techniques and methods of compatible TAO form how much possible, keeping the population of the plague in levels under those capable ones to cause economic damage ([WAQUIL], J. M; [VIANA], P.;
CROSS, 1. 2006. Culture of the Corn. System of production. 2 [ed]. [Embrapa]).
[9] In Brazil, until the year of 2009, they were registered 28 [feromonios] for the control of insect-plague in agriculture, for the National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance ([ANVISA], National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance. 2009. http://www.cnpma.embrapa.br/down [sitefforum]/2009/palestras/2 ANVISA Carlos Al [exandre].pdf access in 12/02/2014). Such [feromonios] are used in the [monitoramento], [massal] capture and in the sexual confusion of plagues.More than 90% of the commercial products the base of [feromonios] is used in the [monitoramento], that consists of the capture of males and/or females for detention of population surges, time of emergency of the adult insects and detention of presence, distribution and abundance of insects ([IBARRA], R. T. L. B. 2006. [Monitoramento] de [Leucoptera] coffeella with trap of sexual [feromonio]. Dissertation. Federal University of Lush. LUSH, MINAS GERAIS).
[10] [Utirzac];.5.deg. of [feromonios] in I especially cope it integrated of plagues that attack cultures of significant economic value have been very spread out, in the last times.Thus, the study, the characterization and the development of routes of synthesis of the components of these [feromonios] they have been [substanciaTmenfe], intensified.
[11] Diverse groups of [pesqt]. [Hsadores] comes [tnlhalii]3ndo in [identificacan] of the components of [feromonios] and, until present TM [ento], already the information are available on these components in some databases.For example, ""[The] Pherobase"" (available in the [Web] in http://www.pherobase.net/) that presents [feromonios] of pertaining insects to [famiH] Oe -;! [ae], which the drill of the fruit of the [anonaceas] belongs, and was elucidated until now.Although already they exist [diversns] feromonios identified and its elucidated composition, it does not have reference to the [feromonio] of [anonelia] the [Cerconota] species.Also registers of deposits of patents for [feromonais] formulations [do] not exisem until the present moment involving the drill of the fruit of the [anonaceas], object [dest]-, patent.Some relative registers to the [Oecophopridae] family can [be] enccrsrados, but gaseous [fumigadores] mention to the pesticide application as it is the case of the Fluoride of [sulfonila] ([DE]19633595C1; [DE]19651705C2) and its combination with an ester and carbonic gas
[12] In Brazil, already studies exist that demonstrate the efficiency in the use of synthetic [feromonios], as for example, the use of the [Rincoforolc], [feromonio] of [av] option of the drill of the eye of the coconut palm.As for the [Lepidoptera] order, more [sspecificamente] the drills, [flavipennella] discovered in Brazil is valid to highlight the [feromonio] of the [Diatraea] drill recently, whose formulation possesses deposit of patent under [n] PI 0903698-9 developed by the group of chemical ecology, responsible for the present product.This formulation possesses high [c]-ficiencia under conditions of field ([Kalinova] et al.B. [Kalinova], R. R. Of the Birth, M. [Hoskovec]. the L. [Mendonca], E. L. Silva, M. R. T. Of Freitas, C. R. [Cabral]-Jr, C. E. Silva.. E. G. [SanfAna] &. the [Svatos].

[pp].203 211) when employees raw traps for capture and [rnachos] vsando are population reduction of [especr] for indices under the level of economic damage.
[0131 Thus, the use of [fero], [aios] in the control and for behavior of plagues come Sendo faced as alternative interesting insofar as its environmental impact least when it is compared with the other forms of control of plagues.This possibility has contributed very to the knowledge of the reproductive habits of the insects that attack the plantations of important cultures More than this, the knowledge of the [somonios] components of [iu].setos has been important for the control of diverse plagues
[0141 Given to the importance of the [feromonios] in the b ***.deg.controle of insect-plague. some proposals of synthesis of [feromonios] have been told [emtrabalhos] published and in patent documents.Therefore, it is possible to say that the main components of known [feromonios] are available commercially. or routes of synthesis for its attainment are known, fact this that potentials take them products that can be applied in the form of specific formulations and [aor] - [olamente] aceltavei disp onibilidde c and components of [feromon] has allowed [ciesenvo] l [rnento] [v]' it i of position with [feromonal] activity.

[Exen], 3: [Bioensaios] for determination of the biological activity of composites under laboratory conditions
[32] The biological activity of the other identified components was tested in preliminary [bioensAios] under the same here described conditions, however [co] was not [rls], ATI, 3 as attractive for C. [anonella], Sendo, therefore the [bioensaios] were executed in a glass enclosure for bullfighting (14,8 cm x 30 cm x 20,3 cm) with a perforated cover, [colowila] were rhyme dark room in the following conditions:
temperature of 21,46 0,73.deg. C; relative humidity of 84,00 3.87% and one [fotoperiodo] of 12L: 12D. The comments were accomplished during [escotofase] using a red light bulb of 15 [Watts]. The composites identified were synthetized in laboratory and diluted in hexane in the concentrations of 0,1mg/mL and 1mg/mL. Aliquot (10 [pL]) of each solution they were applied on the record of filter paper ([Whatman] [n] 01, 4) 20mm). After the evaporation of the solvent, the records were placed in the glass container.A male virgin (with age of 1-3 days) was introduced in the enclosure for bullfighting and its behavior as well as the time the necessary it will reach the [feromonio] source was registered per 10 minutes.
[033] All the experiments were lead using 10 (ten) repetitions for treatment and the changeable following, based in the behavior of cuts shown for males, was considered and quantified: (1) vibration of wing, (2) short and fast flight, (3) touch in the source and (4) copula attempt. [Bioensaios] with hung alive females virgin in polyethylene river steamer had served as treatment-witness and impregnated records of paper with hexane, as well as clean records also was tested serving as treatment controls and white, respectively.Table 2 presents the comparison of the average values of each treatment tested in respect to the treatment controls (female alive).

[034] The data of table 2 demonstrate that the chemical components, when tested individually, they had presented similar answers in the males of C. [anonella], however such answers are [sign]'i; [iamente] lesser when compared with the treatments of saturated mixtures, [insaturadas] and female alive, for all the tested variable ([p]<0,05). Concerning these last treatments, the [insaturados] composite mixture, as well as its ratio, was [esc]; [nlida] on the basis of the saturated analyses of identification of its analogous ones.It Is possible to verify that the biological activity of both the mixtures (ternary saturated and ternary [insaturada]) were to that they had bridden an answer more effective for the variable (-: t. : [didas] relative to the behaviors shown for the males, when compared the female (witness).The presence of I acidify it [octanoico] inhibited the [res]: ', 3te of the males for all the variable.Structurally, this composition is similar to the [biossinteticos] precursors, being coherent with literature stories, that consider the absence of the [bios] precursors, -1, - [ticos] in the composition of the sexual [feromonio] of lepidopterons ([SUBCHEV] M.

Sendo thus, can be considered that the presence of the [OA] can interfere negatively with the intensity of the answer to the composite mixture that constitutes the sexual [feromonio] of C. [anonella]. As for the tested concentrations, an increase of answer with an increase of the concentration of the mixture was evidenced.Thus, the concentration of 1 [mg]/mL was considered more efficient in the attractiveness of the males for all the studied variable and treatments.
[035] On the basis of these results it was possible to conclude that the mixtures I contend saturated composites and [insaturados], SEM the presence of I acidify it [octanoico] and in the concentration of 1 [mg]/mL, both in the ratios of 1:3: 5, were TAO efficient how much the alive females in the attraction of the males, under laboratory conditions.

ii) Evaluation of the [antimicrobiana] activity
[016] For the tests of [antimicrobiana] activity the following was used micro-organisms:
- [Staphylococcus] aureus ([ATCC] 25923);
- [Escherichia] coli ([ATCC] 25922);
- [Aeruginosa] Pseudomonas ([ATCC] 27853); e
- [Candida] albicans ([ATCC] 10231).
[17] These [cepas] standardized and were distributed by the [American] Type Cell Collection ([ATCC], [Manassas]/VA/USA). The micro-organisms were kept in coolant with temperature between 4 and 8 ***.deg.C until now of the use.
a) Activation and preparation of [inoculo] microbian
[18] In essay pipe I contend 5 approximately [mL] of the half [BHI] ([brain]-heart in usion broth), was activated 1 record or approximately MG of the micro-organism.This material was placed in heats bacteriological for 24 hours 35.deg.C and after this period was sown with platinum handle in plate of [Mueller]-Hinton Agar (for bacteria) or [Sabouraud] Agar Dextrose (for C. [albicans]). This plate was placed in heats bacteriological in the same previous conditions. [Inoculo] from the colonies of microbian culture Was Prepared becoming a suspension of each micro-organism in [tamponada] saline solution (solution to the chloride base of sodium, potassium chloride, [monobasic] potassium phosphate and [dibasico] sodium phosphate).
b) Determination of the Least Inhibiting Concentration (CIM)
[19] The least inhibiting concentration (CIM) is defined as the lesser concentration of an agent antimicrobials capable to hinder the visible growth of a micro-organism in tests of sensitivity for dilution in agar or broth.These methods are equally acceptable quantitatively to measure the activity in vitro of an agent isolated determined antimicrobials against one microbian one. 2012 Must be observed that the final result is influenced in significant way for the methodology, that must carefully be controlled to obtain itself resulted [reprodutiveis] ([CLSI],). This essay of determination of the [CIM] was accomplished following the technique of [microdilution] in broth.
[Antifungico] Essay
[20] The test of determination of [CIM] against [Candida] albicans was adapted of document [M]27-A3 ([CLSI] - [Clinicai] and Laboratory Standards Institute. [Reference] method will be [broth] dilution antifungal susceptibility testing of yeasts: Standard [Approved] - [third] edition. [CLSI] document M27-A3, 2008).
[21] G of each sample Was Weighed 0,05 and [was] solubilizou in [dimetilsulfoxido] ([DMSO]) for a final volume of 1 [mL]. [ML] of the way of culture [BHI] was added 100 1.iL of this solution to a flask contends 4,9, obtaining itself, thus, a solution with concentration of 1000 [p].g/mL of the sample and 2% of [DMSO].
[22] 100 were placed [iaL] of way of culture in each well of the [microdilution] plate, except in the ones of the line of plate 1.In this line, 200 1,11 were added, of the solution of the samples (in the 1000 concentration ***.micro.g/mL), in duplicate.
[23] The samples were diluted of [seriada] form leaving 100 III, of the line of plate 1 and transferring them to line B, leaving 100 of this and transferring them to line C, leaving 100 [mi] of this and transferring them to the D and thus successively until line H of the second plate, whose 100 IT WENT, removed they were despised. 500 the obtained concentrations were of [ggimL] (line of plate 1) to 0.01 ***.micro.g/[mL] (line H of plate 2).
[24] In each well-test they were added to 100 ***.micro.L of the suspension of C. [albicans], obtaining one [inoculo] with equal density to 1-5 x 10 3 [UFC]/mL.
suspension was obtained of the following way: from the fungous suspension with equal [turvacao] to pipe 5 of the scale of [McFarland], a dilution of 1:10 in [tamponada] saline solution became (100 [juL] of suspension in 900 1,1L of saline solution), followed of a dilution of 1:1000 in [BHI] (10),11, of suspension in 9,9 [BHI] [mL]).
[25] The following was used well-control for the essay: wells with the used solvent ([DMSO] to 2%) and [inoculo] microbian as control negative; wells with the way of culture and [inoculo] as growth control; e wells I contend only the way of culture (SEM [inoculo]) as sterility control of the plate.The plates were incubated in heat bacteriological to a temperature of 35 ***.deg.C. The reading of the result was made 24 hours of incubation after, from the comment of the [turvacao] in the wells of the [microdilution] plate: it was considered as criterion of the end point the total inhibition of the fungous growth, that is, to [CIM] was determined by the well with the lesser concentration of tested sample in which it did not have [turvacao].
[26] The least inhibiting concentrations of the [ligantes] and its complexes against [Candida] albicans are presented in Table 2.

[Antibacterial] Essay
[27] The test of determination of [CIM] against [Staphylococcus] the [aureus] one, [Escherichia] coli and [aeruginosa] Pseudomonas was adapted of document [M]7-A9 ([CLSI] - [Clinicai] and Laboratory Standards Institute. [Methods] will be [dilution] antimicrobial susceptibility tests will be bacterium [that] grow aerobically: Standard [Approved] - [ninth] edition. [CLSI] document M07-A9, 2012).
[28] G of each sample Was Weighed 0,05 and [was] solubilizou in [dimetilsulfoxido] ([DMSO]) for a final volume of 1 [mL]. [ML] of the way of culture was added 100 1AL of this solution to a flask contends 4,9 broth [Mueller]- Hinton, obtaining itself, thus, a solution with 1000 concentration ***.micro.g/mL
of the sample and 2% of [DMSO].
[29] 100 were placed [pL] of way of culture in each well of the [microdilution] plate.In the line of plate 1, 100 were added more [juL]
of the solution of the samples, in duplicate.
[30] The samples were diluted of [seriada] form leaving 100 [pL] of the line of plate 1 and transferring them to line B, leaving 100 [pL]
of this and transferring them to line C, leaving 100 p, L, of this and transferring them to the D and thus successively until line H of the second plate, whose 100 III, removed were despised. 500 the obtained concentrations were of ***.micro.g/[mL] (line of plate 1) to 0.01 ***.micro.g/mL (line H of plate 2).For samples whose [CIM] were minor who 0.01 ***.micro.g/mL, happened again the essay with lesser concentrations, that is, making more dilutions.
[31] In each well-test 5 were added [gi], of the bacterial suspension, obtaining one [inoculo] with equal density approximately to 5 x [UFC]/mL. The suspension was obtained of the following way: from the microbian suspension with equal [turvacao] to pipe 5 of the scale of [McFarland], a dilution of 1:10 in [tamponada] saline solution became (100 P. I., of suspension in 900 [IlL] of saline solution), followed of another dilution of 1:10 in [tamponada] saline solution (100 ***.micro.L of suspension in 900 ***.micro.L of saline solution).
[32] The following was used well-control for the essay: wells with the used solvent ([DMSO] to 2%), the way of culture and [inoculo] microbian as control negative; wells with the way of culture and [inoculo] as growth control; e wells I contend only the way of culture (SEM [inoculo]) as sterility control of the plate.
[33] The plates were incubated in heat bacteriological to 35 ***.deg.C for 18 hours and after this time was added 20! there, of a watery solution of [TTC] ([trifenil] chloride [tetrazolium]) to 0.5% to each well.The plates [were] reincubadas by more 3 hours.
[34] The reading of the result was made the incubation period after, from the comment of the appearance of a red coloration in the wells of the [microdilution] plate: it was considered as criterion of the end point the total inhibition of the bacterial growth, that is, to [CIM] was determined by the well with the lesser concentration of tested sample in which it did not have the coloration appearance.
[35] The red coloration in the wells indicates microbian growth e, consequently, the inactivity of the sample against the micro-organism tested in that concentration.Contrarily, the absence of the red coloration indicates absence of microbian growth and the [antimicrobiana] activity of the sample against the micro-organism tested in that concentration.This occurs due to reduction of the [TTC] (colorless) to a red coloration for the alive colonies.
[036] The least inhibiting concentrations of the [ligantes] and its complexes against the bacteria selected for this study are presented in Table 3.

""PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR [CICATRIZA]ÇAO OF WOUNDS [UTILI]- ZANDO [virgilioides] EXTRACTS DE [Bowdichia] [KUNTH]""
Field of the Invention
The present invention mentions the extract application to it, mainly watery, the spirituous one and [hidroalcoolico] of the rinds of the stalks, [entrecasca], leaves and [virgilioides] seeds of [Bowdichia], separately or in mixture of different ratios of these products and/or next to (s) extract (s) of other natural and/or synthetic sources, used (s) to compose preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, in particular in the presentations for topical use, form of lotions, ointments, you cremate, [geis], spray and aerosols, used for treatment of wounds of Pele, understanding formulations I contend mentioned extracts, fractions of these materials and/or constituent (s) chemical (s), used as active beginnings and/or pharmacological excipient.
Pele serves as a protective barrier against agents of the environment, and the loss of the cutaneous integrity, and the absence of an adjusted repair, can provide serious to systemic deficiencies or same death.The [cicatrizacao] is a process repair salary that after occurs injury unchained for stimuli of different natures.The [cicatrizacao] occurs in 3 phases: proliferation, inflames dog and remodelling.Thus, the wounds demand intensive cares with the cleanliness to avoid bacterial growth, fabric training of exuberant granulation and excessive retraction of the scar.The possibility to be interfered positively with the [cicatricial] process can mean a profit in the quality of life of the patients, beyond reduction of cost in the dismissed cares and the improvement of the final quality of the regenerative process.Although available medication for the treatment of cutaneous wounds, the cost and the adverse reactions to the patient to exist are revealed as factors that limit to the use.
On the [Bowdichia] virgilioides
[Bowdichia] virgilioides, known popularly as brazilian tree-black color, is a tree found in the Brazilian regions north, northeast and center-west.
plant possesses thick rind and [fendilhada] it reaches up to 20 meters of height, presenting trunk with next diameter to 60 centimeters.It Presents composed leaves, [pinadas], with [pubescentes] foliolos.You flourish Them, with corolla lilacs confer an ornamental and apicultural aspect to the tree, that blossoms between the months of October and December. The fruits are vegetables, [indeiscentes], flattened, contend seeds with 3-5 [mm] of length, presenting [amarronzada] coloration.The [etnofarmacologia] discloses to the use of the decoction or infusion of the seeds in the combat the inflammation in the throat and rheumatism (Alves, 2007; [p].186, Searches Electronic of Pharmacy). Works found in literature describe that the [virgilioides] rinds of the stalk of [Bowdichia] present the composed chemical constitution for [isoflavonoides], alkalis and [terpenos].
State of the Technique
The treatments of the cutaneous injuries include the medication use in different types of formulations, varying in after, lotions, cremate, [geis], folders, ointments, spray, aerosols, Independent etc. of the type of medication, the treatment of the injuries have great clinical importance due to the time of resolution, caused discomfort and necessity of daily cares that present.Moreover, the available medication beyond being able to present potential annoy dog the drawn out periods of exhibition, have in the price another factor that limits the access to the product.Amongst available medication, to follow we have most used for [cicatrizacao] of cutaneous wounds: a) [Fibrase] (a): it is indicated in the treatment of injuries cutaneous, such as burnings, you fester and wounds where the double action as [debridante] agent and antibiotic topic.For this medication already cases of [hipoplasia] of bone marrow were told, including [aplastica] anemia and death. b) [Dennazine]0: it possesses in its composition [Sulfadiazina] de Prata 1% [micronizada] with action mechanism on the cellular membrane and microbian cellular wall, promoting the weakness of these, with consequent disruption of the cell, being there its bactericidal effect.As vanity little absorption in human fabrics can highlight its, beyond when used in very extensive areas of corporal surface, the [monitoracao] of the [sericos] levels of Sulfa drug and the renal function becomes important.In addition, some of the adverse reactions usually seen with systemic sulfonamide (syndrome of [Stevens]-
[Johnsos], syndrome of [Lyell] s, [driscrasia] and [cristaluria]) can occur during therapy with [Dermazine], even so rare they have been told and depends on the percentage of corporal surface where [Dermazine] is applied and the depth of the fabric injured.
Summary of the Invention
For the displayed one, she is evidenced necessity of alternative medication availability for treatments of the cutaneous injuries with intention to speed up the [cicatricial] process.For in such a way, the [fitoterapicos] products are presented through this instrument of industrial property that include in its formulation the active beginnings rinds of the stalk, [entrecasca], leaves and [virgilioides] seeds of [Bowdichia] (brazilian tree).The developed products were evaluated in pre-clinical tests, whose resulted therapeutical they represent an innovative alternative will speed up the [cicatrizacao] of cutaneous wounds, as it can be observed in table 1 that it after evidences the reduction of the area of the wound in 6 and 9 days injury and the time (in days) of [epitelizacao] of the wound.

Detailed Description of the Patent
Example of Attainment of the extract: She Is Prepared infusion or decoction with 50 grams of rind of the [virgilioides] stalk of wearied [Bowdichia] and dries the ambient temperature in 300 milliliters of water.After rest of 12 hours the ambient temperature the product is filtered in paper ([Watman] in. 2) and the concentrated filtered one in [Iiofilizador].
Example: of Preparation of the formulation in it cremates
For this formulation it was used cremates [anionico], a composition of [autoemusionantes] waxes, [propilenoglicol], [triglicerides] of I acidify it [caprico], [metilparabenos], [propilparabenos], [imidazolidinil] urea, [dimeticone], [BHT], [dissodico] EDTA and [deionizada] water.The formulation is prepared heating the oily phase 75.deg.C and the watery phase 80.deg.C. She Was Shed watery phase to the oily phase, under vigorous agitation.After that, agitation was diminished and cools to it 40.deg.C approximately to it.Later, complementary phase was added to it, was homogenized and cooled until reaching the ambient temperature.The [pH] Was Verified and corrected it for 5,5 to 6,5, with the aid of the [acidulantes] or [alcalinizantes] solutions.It cremates It obtained, soon for use, then was transferred to containers I contend formulations of 1 to 10% ([p]/p) of it I begin asset.
Collection of the material botanist
The watery extract of [Bowdichia] virgilioides was obtained from the rinds of the stalk. [Simoes] B. C., [UFAL], [Maceio] - [AL] in different months of the year Had Been Collected rinds of stalks of [virgilioides] healthy plants of [Bowdichia] in the [Arboreto] of the Campus (March, June, September and December). A copy of the plant [Bowdichia] virgilioides Kunth meets in the [herbario] of the Institute of the Environment of the State of [Alagoas] ([IMA]-AL) under register [MAC]29914.
[Toxicologicos] Tests
The [toxicologicos] tests were accomplished with mice of the [Mus] species [musculus].
The evaluation of the toxic activity of the watery extract used 20 mice of the [Mus] species [musculus], healthy, male and female adults and.The animals were weighed in half-analytical scale (0,001g) and divided in 5 groups, Sendo all the treatments accomplished for saw verbal in a 200 volume of [pL] for animal.The animals of [virgilioides] group 1 had received the watery extract from [Bowdichia], [ressuspendido] in water in dose of 0,4 [g].kg -1 of corporeal weight.In 2.deg. group doses it was of 0,2 [g].kg -1 of corporeal weight.In group 3, it doses it was of 0,1 [g].kg 1 of corporeal weight.In group 4, it doses it was of 0,05 [g].kg -1 of corporeal weight.In group 5, the animals had received only watery solution.After different times of the verbal treatment, that varied of 1h up to 8 days, were not registered deaths or any modification in the profit of weight of the animals, and no hematologic modification or in the [celularidade] of bone marrow was detected.Valley to highlight that the macroscopic analysis of the stomachal and intestinal mucosa, kidneys, spleen, lung and heart did not disclose no visible modification under condition of treatment with extract.
Pharmacological Tests
The pharmacological evaluations, daily pay - clinical of the watery extract of [Bowdichia] virgilioides it was accomplished in vivo for the activity of primary irritation of Pele and cutaneous [cicatrizacao].
The mice, males and females of the [Mus] species [musculus], used in the experiments were deriving of the Central [bioterio] of the [UFAL]. The animals were treated against parasitize ([vermifugados]) and acclimatized in the sectorial [bioterio] of the [ICBS]/UFAL.
The tests of primary irritation of Pele were accomplished in accordance with [BRITO] (1994), with modifications that had consisted of the application of the formulation on the Pele straightforward of the animals.Three adult mice were used.The animals were accommodated in individual river steamers the ambient temperature, periods of and clearly dark of 12h, with access the ration and water ad libitum.The animals were depilated in the dorsal region, 24 hours before the application, Sendo demarcated application places. 0,01g.ml was applied 200 [pL] of the watery extract of the rinds (.: 1), in one doses only, on the Pele of the animals.After that, the animals were placed in separate river steamers for four hours.To the end of the period of exhibition one searched to verify had the training of [eritema], scabs or edemas.Cutaneous modifications in the period of evaluated time were not observed.
In the [cicatrizacao] test 25 mice were used.The animals were depilated in the dorsal region and accomodated in individual river steamers the ambient temperature, periods of and clearly dark of 12h, with access the ration and water ad libitum.The animals had received numb local with [inalatoria] [cloridrato] of [lidocaina] and with sulphuric ether.An incision of 1 cm 2 in the Pele of the dorsal region of each animal until reaching the subcutaneous one was made.
The animals were divided in 5 groups and had received treatment during the 9 days from experiment.Group 1, control, received saline solution [NaCI] to 0.9%. Group 2 was dealt with [Fibrase](R) and group 3 was dealt with [virgilioides] the watery solution [Bowdichia], [ressuspendidos] in water (0,01g/mL). Group 4 received treatment with cremates done from the extract of [Bowdichia] virgilioides. [Virgilioides] group 5 received treatment with extract from formulated [Bowdichia] in petroleum jello ointment.The cuts had stayed open and the animals had received the treatment since the day from the incision until 9.deg. day from experiment.Macroscopic analyses how much to the degree of [cicatricial] and microscopical retention how much to the [epitelizacao] degree were made.
It Can be evidenced that the injuries accomplished surgically and dealt daily with [virgilioides] extract to [Bowdichia], [Fibrase](R) and sterile salt mine, had presented a different profile in the cure process.We Notice that the extract of [Bowdichia] virgilioides after propitiated one better action already in 3 days beginning of the treatment, where was not observed the purulent secretion presence.Therefore, [virgilioides] the [cicatrizante] action of the extract of [Bowdichia], when in formulation presented in the form of standard cremates and comparative to the substance, was revealed evident to happening the [cicatrizante] test in wound model.

Beyond the which cited patents, bars of differentiated cereals can be found in the national market, as for example: bars additive Brazilian organic cereals, SEM or preservatives (http://bio2orqanic.com.br/produtos) or with high staple fiber text (http://vvww.lineasucralose.com.briprodutos/barrasde-cereais/banana-e-aveia).
The format of bars of cereals attentive, mainly, to adjust it the [praticidade] searched in the present time for accomplishment of snacks fast ones, promptly available for consumption and associates to the idea of healthy feeding, beyond a BoA acceptance for the consuming market ([Holmer]. the [Healthy] Snack Preferences in Danish and Swedish School Children.

As seen, already bars exist that take advantage of some residues in its composition.
Currently, an increasing concern with the exploitation of solid residues ([ABRELPE] is observed (Brazilian Association of Companies of Public Cleanliness and Special Residues). Panorama of the solid residues in Brazil. 2010; BRAZIL. [Law N. 12,305, of 2 of August of 2010].National Politics of solid residues [electronic resource]. - 2. [ed]. - Brasilia:
Edition, House Of Representatives Chamber, 2012. 73 p).In literature widely described forms of exploitation meet, especially in nourishing industry.For example, the exploitation of rinds, seeds and other parts of vegetables for use in the confection of candies and nutritional desserts in general, juices, bars of cereals and other forms of culinary presentation ([SESC] (Bureau of Trade) - National Department.
Bank of foods and urban harvest: Integral Exploitation of foods. 45p, 2003; Fortress J. M.; [Peixoto] J.; [Junqueira] N. T. V.; Oliveira. the T.; [Rangel] L. E. P. Characteristic physics and chemistries in nine genotypes of cultivated acerbic passion fruit under three levels of [potassica] fertilization. [Rev]. [Bras]. Frutic. 27(1): 124-127, 2005; Silva I. Q.; Oliveira B. C. F.; [Lopes]. the S.; Penalty R. S.
Attainment of bar of cereals added of the industrial residue of passion fruit. [Alim]. [Nutr]. 20(2): 321-329, 2009). However, the reality is the discarding in common garbage of viable prime substance for the [reaproveitamento], what it hinders or it minimizes the possibilities of separation and sustainable exploitation of these materials and a huge probability of environmental contamination and the individuals that search in its separation its source of survival ([Sisinno] C. L. S.; [Moreira] J. C. Evaluation of the contamination and environmental pollution in the area of influence of the controlled embankment of the Hill of the Sky, [Niteroi], Brazil. CAD. [Publ] Health. 12(4): 515-523, 1996).
For the alimentary residues, this reality is not different.The incorrect discarding hinders, also, the exploitation of this type of material for agriculture and nourishing industry, due to the fast putrescence, associate to the incorrect storage.These events elapse, especially, due to the nutritional constituents that are attractive and sources of nutrition and reproduction of the microorganisms contaminants ([Hoffmann] F. L. [limitantes] Factors to the proliferation of microorganisms in foods.Brazil Foods. 9, 2001). In this way, you mine, vitamins and staple fibers are discardable, instead of taken advantage of as source suplemental of these vital elements to the animal organisms.
With relation specifically to the residue of the crab, the problem of environmental pollution, from residues of crustaceans in general, is real.
problem [independe] of the development of the country.However (in the developed countries more strategies of its commercial exploitation ([Ayangbile] are cited..; [Fontenot] J. P.; [Graham] P. P.; [Kirk] D. J.; Allen V. G. Nutrient Utilization [by] Sheep and Performance [and] Carcass Characteristics of Steers Fed Crab Waste-Straw Silage. J. [Anim]. [Sci]. 76:686-693, 1998; Rabbit T. L.

Characterization of the used crabs
Crabs are crustaceans found in the littoral regions of all the o world.Some species preferentially are found in areas of sweet water fens (Lee S. Y. Ecological roll [of] grapsid crabs in mangrove ecosystems: [review]. Sea [Freshwater] [Res]. 49(4): 335-343, 1998). These animals are highly adaptable to the way and therefore they can live in polluted waters (Silva D. F.; Silva D. F.; Souza F. the Z. environmental Degradation, irregular occupation and I cope sustainable in [the] [estuarino]***-lagunar complex [Mundau]/Manguaba, state of [Alagoaas] (AL). Environmental Engineering. 5(3): 152-170, 2008). They Possess a rigid carapace in the back and is from the size of this carapace, variable in accordance with the species, that many times is determined the prohibition or release of its capture for marketing
([Melo] G. ([Ed]). Manual of identification of the [Crustacea] decapoda of sweet water of Brazil. Sao Paulo: [Loyola] Editions, 2003). They Are sufficiently vulnerable in the period of reproduction, as much for the displacement, how much for the exchange of the carapace of the females and the environmental agencies, the least in Brazil, determines an annual calendar of the periods where the capture and any type of marketing stay forbidden (BRAZIL. Ministry of Pesca and [Aquicultura]. Normative Instruction Inter-ministerial [N] 1 of 9 of January of 2013.Federal Official Gazette, Section 1, of 10 of January of 2013, [p].37. 2013). The shops whom coincident supply with the period known has for ""walked"" must regularize its situations front to the competent agencies ([Araujo]
M. S. L. C.; [Negromonte]..; [Barreto]. the V. [Reproductive] period of the swimming crab Callinectes danae at the Cruz Channel Saint, [highly] productive tropical [estuary] in Brazil. [Nauplius]. 19(2): 155-162, 2011; BRAZIL. Ministry of Pesca and [Aquicultura]. Normative Instruction Inter-ministerial [N] 1 of 9 of January of 2013.Federal Official Gazette, Section 1, of 10 of January of 2013, [p].37. 2013).
In [Alagoas], more specifically in the city of [Maceio], the species most common are the crab-uca ([Ucides] cordatus) ([Araujo] M. S. L. C.; Quiet T. C. S. [Bioecologia] of Crab [Ucides] cordatus ([Linnaeus]) in Complexo [Estuarino] [Lagunar] Mundau/Manguaba ([CELMM]), [Alagoas], Brazil. it Search of the Integrated Coastal Management. 8(2): 169-181, 2008) e [guaiamum]
([Condisoma] guanhumi) ([Ogawa] N. B. P.; [Moreira] R.; Hunter B. C..; [Ogawa] M. Component of the crab flavor.Part 1 - Free Amino Acids in the meat [in] natura. [Rev]. [Cient]. [Prod]. [Anim]. 2(2): 152-156, 2000). First if he reproduces, preferentially, in the region of the fens and second in the more arenaceous places ([Melo] G. ([Ed]). Manual of identification of the [Crustacea] decapoda of sweet water of Brazil. Sao Paulo: [Loyola] Editions, 2003). With respect to the maintenance of the species, is pointed the necessity of educational and structural interventions to preserve the natural habitat, degraded for the presence of irregular marginal occupations and for not sustainable the economic activities (Silva D. F.; Silva D. F.; Souza F. the Z.
Environmental Degradation, irregular occupation and I cope sustainable in [the] [estuarino]***-lagunar complex [Mundau]/Manguaba, state of [Alagoas] (AL). Environmental Engineering. 5(3): 152-170, 2008). Stories in local newspapers were found pointing the difficulty to obtain and to commercialize the crabs, especially associates with its irregular [extrativismo], diminishing the populations ([Assumcao] F. Crab [guaiamum] are imported of the Bahia. 09 of May of 2004.Available in:
< http://gazetaweb.globo.com/gazetadealagoas/acervo.php?c=52349 >. Access in: January of 2013). [Ademais], the size of the animals also captured is minor who that one pointed in other studies with the same species
([Araujo] M. S. L. C.; Quiet T. C. S. [Bioecologia] of Crab [Ucides] cordatus ([Linnaeus]) in the [Estuarino] Complex [Lagunar] Mundau/Manguaba
([CELMM]), [Alagoas], Brazil. it Search of the Integrated Coastal Management. 8(2): 169 - 181, 2008).
The alimentary search it residue used in the composition proposal, the crab carapace, was based on the local economy, but with global marketing potential. [Alagoas], although to present a comparative small littoral extension to other Brazilian states, has an ample complex [to] lagunar, where fens are found many times spoiled for the inadequate exploration and the accumulation of residues of indiscriminate form, compromising the fauna and it flourishes it local and the activity you work of the messengers.
More than what this, the residue of the crab is great e generates bigger amount of residue, adjusted more for manipulation, compared with other [crustaceas] carapaces also found in the region as [sururu], [massunin] and shrimp.Moreover, exactly Sendo an animal that uses itself of the filtration to obtain the nutrients of its feeding, these absorbs in its meat little environmental contaminants, when comparative with other filter ones as the molluscs, between which [sururu] sufficiently has [socioeconomica] representation in the state (Son V. E. M.; [Vaz] M. S..; Maranhao S. C. [organoleptica] Evaluation and [bromatologica] analysis, for nutritional ends, of the shrimp, crab and [sururu] ([in] natura) consumed in the island of Are Luis-HARM. CAD.
[Pesq]. 14 (J): 24-34, 2003).
On the other hand, she is stood out limitation of consumption on the part of sensitive individuals to the crustaceans, that is, the [alergenico] potential in people with [hipersensibilidade] ([Musmand] J. J is known.; [Daul] C. B.; [Lehrer] Crustacea allergy. [Clin] Exp Allergy. 23(9): 722-732, 1993). With regard to this possible collateral effect happened of the ingestion alimentary of the [crustaceas] species, he seems portraied that relative one to the shrimps more.The possible mechanisms are pointed with association to the inflammatory signalling ([Borges] E. L.; Oliveira D. R.; [Barcelos] L. S.; Fishing Boat J. L. [Cytokine] profile of rats fed [diet] containing shrimp. [Rev]. [Nutr]. 26(1): 59-65, 2013). However, also it is regulated the production and marketing through specific norms in the [rotulagem] of the products of crustaceans, as the [quitosana] (BRAZIL.

Picture 2: List of ""new ingredients"" that when used in dismissed products of the register obligatoriness, these products will have register obligatoriness. 2009). Moreover, research is developed in the direction to research if derived products induce allergic reactions in the same intensity that the consumption alimentary of its direct nourishing preparations (Villacis J.; [Rice] T. R.; [Bucci] L. R.; [EI]***-Dahr J. M.;
[Wild] L.; [DeMerell] D.; [Soteres] D.; [Lehrer] S. B. Of [shrimp]-allergic individual [tolerate] shrimp-derived glucosamine? [Clin] Exp Allergy. 36(11): 1457-1461, 2006).
It Is important still to stand out the versatility of the formulations proposals.
In the present document they are proposals three of them: a base, that corresponds to a bar of cereals confectioned with foods as oats, peanut, sugar [mascavo], among others, described in Table 1 and chosen by its nutritional and [organolepticas] properties.Second with partial substitution of the cereals for flour of crab carapace, that corresponds to the drawing with [carateristicas] of functional food.A third that brings, beyond the functional drawing of the previous bar, the [suplementacao] with amino acids L-Arginine and [L]-valina, chosen will inhibit/will activate, respectively and directly, the involved metabolic way in such a way in the nitric oxide release (IN) as in the inhibition of [arginase], enzyme this that competes with [isoformas] of nitric oxide [sintase] (IN) for the same substratum, the amino acid L-Arginine ([Okonji] R. E.; [Agboola] F. K.; [Adeyinka]. the [Inhibition] and Kinetic
[Studies] of Tortoise ([erosa] Kinixys) [Liver] arginase. [Cameroon] Journal of Experimental [Biology]. 8(1) 1 7-25, 2012). The formulation can present variations of flavor and aroma, in accordance with the substitution of the fruit and the corresponding additive, used in the manipulation, as well as versions with reduced texts of carbohydrates and [lipideos], characterizing a food [diet] and [light], respectively.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is related to a pharmaceutical composition contends the caulerpina (figure 1), for treatment of origin diseases inflamato- laughs, the example of the different forms of arthritis, preferentially the rheumatoid arthritis, osteoartrite, Lupus, psoriasis, disease of Crohn, asthma, COPD, melanoma, disease of Alzheimer, badly of Parkinson and cancer, beyond acute and/or chronic pain, including neuropatica pain, associate to the which cited riots and/or any algica manifestation (painful i.e.) dependant of the participation of ciclooxigenase (COX).
The observation of that COX played role key in the inflammatory processes, associated to the demonstration of the beneficial effects of inhibiters of COX in animal models of inflammation and pain, returns it an attractive target for the therapeutical intervention aiming at the treatment of different diseases of acute and/or chronic inflammatory origin and for the control of inflammatory and neuropatica pain.Exactly the COX-2 Sendo isoforma more associated to analgesic the inflammatory processes/, the paper of the COX-1 cannot completely be rejected.The COX-1 is constituently express in inflammatory cells and studies with mice ""knockout"" COX-1 and selective inhibiters confirm the paper of the COX-1 in models of nocicepcao and inflammation.Wallace, Chapman and McKnight (1999) had demonstrated that selective inhibition of COX-2 with SC -58125 does not inhibit the leucocitario recruitment in the model of induced air bubble for carragenina.While the indometacina, a not selective inhibiter of COX, was capable to inhibit the leucocitario recruitment, suggesting the participation of COX-1 in this model.Granados-Soto and collaborators (2001) had suggested that COX-2 is not related to the formalin test, once celecoxibe, on the contrary of the diclofenaco, was not capable of will reduce inflammatory pain in this model.Moreover, studies with mice knockout COX-1 had not presented greater susceptibilidade to the ulceracao and selective inhibiters of COX-1 had not induced gastric injuries, placing in question the paper only of the COX-1 in the gastric citoprotecao.Such adverse effect is observed with the COX inhibiter use - selective, not indicating that the reduction in the total levels of prostaglandins is more important that the inhibition of prostaglandins generated for only one isoforma of COX (ROUZER; SEA NETT, 2009).
The Caulerpina, component of this invention, is capable to inhibit the inflammatory process and of pain, for a mechanism saw inhibition of COX.
The caulerpina the caulerpina is an isolated majority made up of seaweed of the Caulerpa kind.The caulerpina is a bisindolico alkali and literature describes a variety of pharmacological activity, amongst them antitumoral activity and regulating activity of growth [AYYAD; BADRIA, Alexandria Jounal of Pharmaceutical, 1994, 83, 2/7 -219]. Toxicologicos Studies demonstrate that the caulerpina can be classified as a made up of low toxicidade [VIDAL, et there., Botanic Sea, 1984, 27, 533-537]. Chemically, this alkali has an extra ring of eight members between the two indolicos rings that are incorporated, directly, two groupings esters, that synthetically can be converted through rea- percolate in such a way sufficiently efficient of the point of view synthetic how much of the viability in the attainment of a series of potentially active derivatives.

STATE OF THE TECHNIQUE
Innumerable different inhibiting medications of isoformas of COX (COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3), as examples dipirona and the paracetamol, inhibiters of isoforma COX-3; Selective inhibiting Aspirina(R) and indometacina of COX-1, nimensulido, piroxican, super diclofenaco inhibiting little selective COX-2 and the selective ones
COX-2 as examples the COXIBES lumiracoxib, celecoxib, among others, are available in world-wide the pharmaceutical market, despite its adverse effects, mainly related to the gastrointestinal treatment, renal homostasis, tromboembolicas and cardiovascular diseases, this last Sendo characteristic adverse effects of selective inhibiters of COX-2, as the COXIBES. Although it exists a large amount of useful medications in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, of the class of COX inhibiters, the search for new chemical entities with action on this enzyme, motivates the centers of research and pharmaceutical industries, it has seen that the available ones in the market present relative effectiveness for the diversity of inflammatory diseases and a variety of related adverse effects of its action on COX and bounce, on other therapeutical targets.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It Is object of the present invention to provide to alternatives for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases and/or acute and chronic inflammatory origin, such as the different forms of arthritis, osteoartrite, asthma, among others.The main limitations and the complications associates to the medicinal therapy, usually employed in the treatment of inflammatory agravos, would be contouring or minimized with the pharmaceutical composition I contend caulerpina, agent inhibiter of the enzyme COX.
The caulerpina also is capable to modulate the expression and/or inhibition of citocinas of indirect form, particularly, TNF it and IL1-13 and will inhibit proteins quinases of family MAPK, in the treatment of riots related to acute and/or chronic and/or neuropatica pain in human and not human mammiferous animals.Different of the present medications in the market, this product can easily bring benefits with respect to the absence of adverse effects, low which had mainly cost, the prime substance to be found in all littoral Brazilian, thus the same can be obtained easily, once its seaweed isolation happens in a few stages, minimizing the produced cost when on a large scale.This fact has importance, once the easy access and the aggregate value of this composition can represent an independence of foreign pharmaceutical industries, since the attainment of the prime substance of the antiinflammatory medications, supra - cited, it put up the product and it burdens the System
Only of Health, especially when it is about chronic inflammatory disease.DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
For isolation of the caulerpina diverse seaweed species can be used.In this present invention the caulerpina was obtained of racemosa the Caulerpa species.Racemosa the Caulerpa seaweed was collected in the coastal region of Bessa (7.deg.03'52 "" S134.deg.49'51 ""W), Joao Pessoa, Paraiba. The exsicata of the species (JPB13999) meets deposited in the Herbario Lauro Pires Xavier in the Federal University of the Paraiba. The material botanist was dehydrated to the ambient temperature for 72 hours, Sendo submitted to the extraction for maceration with methanol, obtaining itself the rude metanolico extract (17g). Part of this extract was submitted to the solid partition - I eliminate, using as eluentes hexane, chloroform, acetate of etila and n-butanol.The clorofomica phase was submitted to the column of Sephadex LH-20, having used itself binary system chloroform: methanol 1:1 as eluente, obtaining 23 fractions which was gotten together chromatography in analytical delegating layer after (CCDA), in accordance with the similarity of its factors of retention.The fraction
20/23 were presented as crystals of red color - orange, Sendo coded as Cr -1 (150mg). In such a way, the use altogether of spectral techniques as, RMN 1H and 13 allied C to the use of sophisticated techniques of RMN (HMQC and HMBC) allowed to propose the molecular structure of the isolated substance, known as caulerpina.
After isolation and characterization of the substance, the same can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions, being able to vary preferentially of 0,3 .micro.moi to 6,0 .micro.moi. This band of concentration could be incorporated other preferentially adjuvant not active pharmaceutical substances already known, Sendo, excipients, dispersantes, antirust substances, emollients, sweeteners, flavorizantes, preservatives.
Pre-clinical Studies antinociceptiva Activity: The nocicepcao models are based on the comment of the answer of the animal front to the use of mechanical, thermal or chemical stimuli.In the present invention chemical stimuli in the essays of induced abdominal contortion were used for acidify ascetic and induced nocicepcao for formalin, as well as thermal stimulus in the model of hot plate.Using the essay of abdominal contortion the curve was accomplished doses answer of the caulerpina.The results of figure 2 show that, for it saw verbal, in you dose them of 0,001 - 0,01
- 0.1 - 1 - 10 -100 pmol/kg, the caulerpina induced a inhibition of the number of abdominal contortions, with value of 0150 of 0,2374 pmol/kg.For a comparison with the medication standard to 0150 of dipirona pmol/kg was calculated in 0,1263, demonstrating that the caulerpina is less powerful than dipirona, however with a similar effectiveness (p > 0,05). Being Based on the fact of that the contortion essay is sensitive to a diversity of medication with central and peripheral action, the essay of hot plate was accomplished to evaluate a possible central antinociceptiva activity of the caulerpina.In this essay, the treatment with 100 pmol/kg of caulerpina was capable to increase of significant form the time that the mice had remained in the hot plate in times 60, 90 and 120 minutes.The morphine (15 pmol/kg, s.c.), medication used standard, was capable to increase in all the evaluated times (Table 1).

0,01 after analysis 5 the central antinocicepcao can be resulting not only of the inhibition of the ways opioides, but also of the inhibition of COX-3, one isoforma of COX found in the brain that shares structural and catalytic characteristics with the COX-1 and 2 (CHANDRASEKHARAN et al., 2002). Studies show that the paracetamol and dipirona, antipyretic analgesic medications/, cause antinocicepcao for 10 to inhibit COX-3 preferentially, diminishing, thus, the PGE synthesis 2 CHAN- DRASEKHARAN et al., 2002; BOTTING; AYOUB, 2005).
The data obtained in this essay suggest that the caulerpina is also acting for central mechanisms saw COX-3 inhibition or it will inhibit the generated potentials of action from the opening of vaniloides receivers. 15 For better characterization of antinociceptiva the activity and a possible anti-inflammatory effect of the caulerpina, was accomplished the essay of induced nocicepcao for formalin, considered the model that more comes close to clinical pain (TJOSEN; HOLE, 1997). In this essay, the treatment with 100 pmol/kg of the caulerpina diminished of significant form the time of licked in both the 20 phases of essay with inhibition of 34,5% in the neurogenica phase and 45,6 1% in the phase inflamato- laughs (figure 3).These data can be compared with the indometacina (100 pmol/kg), anti-inflammatory not esteroidal (AINE) used as standard, that inhibited 25.3% of the answer of the animal in the neurogenica phase and 50,0 (: ) /0 in the inflammatory phase.He Is described in the literature that analgesic of central action, as the opioides medications, is capable to inhibit both the phases of the formalin test, while AINEs and corticoides inhibit only the inflammatory phase of the test (MIRANDA et al., 2001;
EL HABAZI et al., 2006). However, selective inhibiters of COX-1 (SC -560) inhibit both the phases of the formalin, demonstrating that AINEs not - selective they are capable of will act in such a way in the neurogenica phase how much in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test (TEGEDER et al., 2001). Saints; Vedana; The Freitas (1998) had demonstrated that they meloxicam it, AINE not - selective, she is capable to inhibit the neurogenica phase in superior concentrations to the necessary ones to inhibit the inflammatory phase of the formalin.
The formalin injection unchains intense nocicepcao, characterized for vigorous licked and shaken in the leg injected with the irritating agent.The answer to the formalin injection is developed in two phases.The neurogenica phase is initiated after the stimulus soon and is drawn out per five minutes.This phase characterized for subsequent the predominant stimulation of staple fibers C to the direct stimulation of the peripheral nociceptores (HUNSKAAR, HOLE, 1987). After the five initial minutes, it has a period of absence of nociceptiva answer that lasts close to ten minutes.After this period of rest, initiates it inflammatory phase with length of approximately fifteen minutes and is related with the release of inflammatory mediators as histamine, serotonina, prostaglandins, bradicinina.It Also Has participation of citocinas as TNF it and IL-10 in this delayed phase (GRANADOS-SOTO et al, 2001).
Thus, on the basis of the results of the nocicepcao essays, it can be suggested that the caulerpina is capable to modulate the peripheral and central nociceptiva answer and that this action can be related the modifications in the synthesis/degradation or action of some inflammatory mediator.
Activity on the motor coordination (sedative Effect and or depressor):
Considering that the essay of abdominal contortion, as well as the essay of hot plate, is based on the mensuration of motor answers of the animals, results false - positive they could be obtained in case that motor incoordenacao for sedation occurred, depression of the central nervous system and/or muscular relaxation.To research if the treatment with the caulerpina would be causing motor incoordenacao, was accomplished the test of ""route-rod"". In this essay, caulerpina (100 pmol/kg) not promoted incoordenacao motor or relaxation muscular that could compromise the permanence of the mice in the revolving bar, to the step that diazepam it (35.1 pmol/kg, i.p.), medication standard of the class of the ansioliticos and hipnoticos, reduced of significant form (*p < 0.01) the time of permanence in the revolving bar (Table 2). This method allows to evaluate the specificity of the nociceptiva substance action, verifying if these promote motor incoordenacao of the animals, either for sedation and/or muscular relaxation (MATTEI; HONEST, 2006). These results exclude the hypothesis of the reduction of the abdominal contortions and the increase of the time of permanence in the hot plate produced caulerpina it to have been resulting of sedative action or interference in the motor capacity of the mice.

Antiinflammatory Activity: Once to the data obtained in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test they had pointed with respect to a possible anti-inflammatory action, he was ava- 20 liada the capacity of the caulerpina will inhibit the leucocitario recruitment, one of the stages of the inflammatory process.For in such a way, the essay of induced cellular migration for carragenina was accomplished.The results obtained in this essay demonstrate that, in comparison with the vehicle (21,55 0,8 x 10 6 leucocitos/mL), the caulerpina inhibited of significant form the leucocitaria migration in 48,34% (11,13 1,7 x 6 leucocitos/mL). While the indometacina inhibited 72.06% of the leucocitaria migration (6,02 0,4 x10 6 leucocitos/mL) (figure 4).
From the peritoneal washed one still the differential counting of leukocytes was accomplished, where it was observed that the caulerpina was capable to reduce the recruitment of polimorfonucleares mainly (Table 3). The mobilization of resulting neutrofilos of the intraperitoneal injection of carragenina increases between 1a and 3a hours, Sendo that the mobilization of monocitos occurs two hours after the presence of polimorfonucleares.

Investigation of the mechanism of action on COX: To research the possible mechanism of action of the caulerpina, was evaluated the capacity of inhibition of COX
in vitro, once the caulerpina showed anti-inflammatory effects in the essay of induced peritonitis for carragenina and in the inflammatory phase of the formalin.In this essay, the caulerpina (0,2 p.m.) was capable to inhibit 77.3% of the activity of COX-1 (p < 0,05) and 44.4% of COX-2 (figure 5).The medication standard I acidify acetilsalicilico inhibited 90% (COX-1) and 82% (COX-2) and the indometacina (0,2 p.m.) inhibited 93% (COX-1) and 78% (COX-2). On the basis of these results, it can be inferred that the antinociceptiva and anti-inflammatory activity in the used models must, in part, I inhibited it dog of COX, once the prostaglandins, resultants of the catalytic action of
COX on I acidify it araquidonico, play an important role in the processes of nocicepcao and inflammation.Thus, the peripheral antinociceptivo effect of the caulerpina in the essay of abdominal contortion can be justified by one possi- vel reduction of the levels of 2 PGE and PGF2a, as well as the inhibition of pain inflames - toria of the formalin test.Moreover, the reduction of the time of latency of the mice in the test of hot plate can involve the COX-3.
Relation structure pharmacological activity: Analysing the structure of the caulerpina the presence of two indois groups is noticed.Possibly this group is responsible for the pharmacological activity of this alkali presented here, once this nucleus is common also the indometacina, a AINE not - selective (Figure 6).
to present chemical groupings in common with the indometacina and to present antinociceptiva/anti-inflammatory activity, can be suggested that the caulerpina can be inhibiting COX of similar form the indometacina, that is, through strong connections time - dependant with this enzyme.Still three forms of inhibition of COX exist others that the AINEs not - selective they can act: (1) through covalentes connections, as it I acidify acetilsalicilico that acetila the residue of serina 530 in COX-1 and 516 in COX-2 (BOTTING, 2006); (2) of competitive form, as ibuprofeno; (3) through weak connections time - dependant, as the naproxeno (BINGHAMA et al., 2006).
The indometacina is also capable to inhibit the stage of clod roller of neutrofilos during the inflammatory process, due to inhibition in the expression of L-selectina in the surface of these cells (DiAZ-GONZALEZ; SANCHEZ-MADRID, 1998). The caulerpina can be acting of similar form, corroborating, thus, with its capacity to inhibit the leucocitario recruitment in the essay of induced peritonitis for carragenina.
The group indol is capable to interact with reactive species of oxygen (ROS), Sendo this another possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of the caulerpina (aTOLC, 1999). ROS induce the increase of the vascular permeability, stimulate quimiotaticos factors, as LTB 4, and the lipidic peroxidacao, causing, then, desregulacao of the cellular function and inducing the tecidual damage, of this form, increasing the inflammatory state (ROOME et al., 2008).
The action antinociceptiv/the nti-inflammatory one of the caulerpina can still be resulting of the action on canabinoides receivers CB1 and CB2, once already she was described in the literature that indolicos groupings present affinity for these types of receivers (FREITAS et al., 2009). The canabinoides receivers, as well as its endogenous ligantes as the anandamida one, are involved in the modulation of pain (revision to see GUINDON, HOHMANN, 2009).
The caulerpina seems not to present sedative effects, established in the results of the test of ""route-rod"", different of the indometacina that presents central adverse effects as giddiness, vertigos, beyond inducing psychosis.The presence of two indois groups in the structure of the caulerpina, against only one presented by the indometacina and serotonina, can be favouring this alkali in what they concern central adverse effects.

MONITORAMENTO AND CAPTURE OF INSECTS""
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
To present urban and agricultural invention one mentions to pest control, specifically to an equipment for capture of insects of the Castniidae family (Telchin licus licus) of the Lepidoptera order, popularly known as Giant Drill, and other insects, objectifying its use as trap for monitoramento and capture of the same, as plagues of the culture of the sugar cane-deio sugar.
ANTECEDENTS OF THE INVENTION AND PREVIOUS TECHNIQUE
The better form to study insects and to accomplish sampling for comment of its habits is the capture.The collection and the handling disclose all-important information, mainly, through the direct comment of the populations how much to diverse aspects (cycle of life, hourly sazonalidade, activities, geographic distribution, habitat, habits, parity and etc.), in view of the study of the populations, above all of the involved species in the destruction of farmings of the sugar sugar cane, soliciting great scientific and didactic evolutions, primordial factor for definition of solutions in the control of vectors of plagues, thus providing economic and ecological benefits.
The Telchin insect licus licus popularly is known in Brazil for the vulgar name of ""Giant Drill"", ""Drill of the Banana trees"" and ""white caterpillar of the sugar cane"".
giant drill has 4 trainings of development: egg; larva; pupa and adult.
larva of the adult train is the responsible for the actual damages, once it all passes its time of life inside of buds of the sugar sugar cane.The damages caused for this plague in sugar industry are of great economic relevance, reaching considerable losses in the culture of sugar cane for hectare and in the production of sugar for ton.
In Brazil the Giant Drill is found in the canaviais of the States of Alagoas, Paraiba, Rio Grande of the North, Para, Amapa, Minas Gerais, Sergipe, Maranhao and recently Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso.
The normally used methods of pest control in canavieiras cultures with use of insecticide and/or pesticides cannot be used for the giant drill, once the caterpillars meet inside of the sugar cane and they are not reached by the action of the poison, allowing that they are developed until the adult phase (the one of the butterfly) and initiate a new cycle of infestation, after the cut of the sugar cane.However, the use of traps (object of the clear present) duly installed in strategic points (inside of the plantation formando a mesh and to the edge of the canavial after the cut of the sugar cane), concomitantly to the use of a feromonal mixture, especially developed in the works accomplished for group LABIS-IQB-UFAL (Reboucas, L. M. C., Caraciolo, M. S. B., Paolino, F.., Griepink, F. C., Bruin. the S., Nunes, C. the M., Saints, G. C., Sant'ana.E. G. (2000). io Female Sex Pheromone of Castnia Licus (Lepidoptera: Castniidae): Identification and Field Application. In: XXI International Congress of Entomology, Foz do Iguacu, V. I. P.717-717), significantly reduces the potential of infestation of the plague and, consequently, the number of executed manual collections with harpoon aid, also considered one of the current methods of control of this plague in the canaviais.
Nothing obstante, what it refers to the previous state of the technique equipment exists (traps) that they develop part of the services of similar form, however, demand the property of traps for capture of insects of small transport (white fly, wasps, mosquitos, aphid, buzzer, cow and diverse other insects), with or without the employment of the yellow panel with entomological glue in the two sides.
The use of these equipment becomes inconvenient, in view of its formats, once in the works accomplished for group LABIS-IQB- UFAL (Reboucas, L. M. C., Caraciolo, M. S. B., Paolino, F.., Griepink, F. C., Bruin. the S., Nunes, C. the M., Saints, G. C., Sant'ana.E. G., 2000 - Female Sex Pheromone of Castnia Licus (Lepidoptera: Castniidae): Identification and Field Application. In: XXI International Congress of Entomology, Foz do Iguacu, V. I. P.717-717; Reboucas, L. M. C., 2007 - presented technical Report to the Trade union of sugar and the Alcohol of the State of Alagoas) is presented tests with common models of traps for capture of lepidopteras, as Delta, Wing and others, and the results were not satisfactory, not to present description of capture of butterflies (Telchin licus licus), exactly using the feromonal mixture developed by group LABIS-IQB-UFAL properly to attract the insects.Ahead of frustrated results, the necessity was seen to conform a model of trap with important format capable to capture the giant butterfly.
Despite the pre-existant traps resemble the equipment (trap) however demanded in the present invention, the primordial difference consists of its composition, has seen to be conformed by two frames of sustentation: one in the vertical line and to another one in the horizontal line, reaching an angle of 90 degrees, in which they are set of continuous form in all the extension of the trap, yellow panels with entomological glue, where the feromonal mixture, placed in imprisoned io septo of rubber in the vertical frame or the glue in the base horizon, exhales aroma that attracts the insect until the trap, attraction this that also is exerted by the yellow color of the panels.
A time attracted by the trap, the insects settle in the vertical and horizontal bases, in which they are apprehended by the glue.However, the insects that are apprehended by the vertical base, due to its weight, do not keep its position for more than close to 5 to 15 minutes, occurring slide of the same for the horizontal base.
The utility and effectiveness of a certain model of trap are changeable in function of the species of insect that the same intends to capture, as well as the amount of adult insects that the same apprehends.Sendo thus, to present trap is especially conformedly and dedicated to the monitoramento and the capture of insects noticedly of the Castniidae family (Telchin licus licus) of the Lepidoptera order (butterflies of great transport).However, she is not restricted to this insect, serving for attraction and capture of other present insects in the canaviais, had in part the yellow color of the panel of the trap.DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
To present invention licus deals with a trap to capture insects of great transport as Butterfly T. licus, therefore differently of the described traps in the state of the technique, to present invention, due to its form of T
invert with a horizontal base, obtains to arrest this type of insect for unlimited time, therefore, when settling in the vertical base, the same he will fall in the horizontal base, staying fixed of permanent form.In the same way, other insects will be attracted it to you by the yellow color, and will be restrained in the horizontal base.Another differential of this invention is the presence of a frame and the continuous entomological glue in all the extension of the Trap, what it facilitates the capture of the insect.
The presence of a feromonal mixture, or another attractive composition, placed in septo of rubber, allows that septo either imprisoned in the frame in the vertical part or the proper glue in the horizontal base.The feromonal mixture, exhales an aroma that attracts the insect for the trap, what it increases the efficiency of the capture of the adult.After to feel the aroma, the insect locates the trap and puts in the positions, vertical line and/or horizontal line, staying imprisoned.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The object of the clear present is practically dedicated to the monitoramento and capture of insects of great transport (Telchin licus licus), among others, where the arrangements, measures, adaptations and functioning guarantee bigger effectiveness in the capture, necessarily characterized for two constructed frames of sustentation of some materials (pipes and connections of 20 PVC of mm, caibro, wood, others): a vertical line and another horizontal line, connected between itself by means of rabbet or bolts, whose both understand the measured following: frame in the vertical line with 50 cm to 120 cm of height and 20 cm to 60 cm of width, and a horizontal frame with 40 cm to 120 cm of length and 20 cm to 60 cm of width, making angle of 90 degrees, representing an inverted T, that in turn starts to call trap TL. After conformed the structure in the format of an inverted T, it connects - to the horizontal and vertical body of the base a yellow panel with 50 cm to 120 cm of length and 20 cm to 60 cm of width and one septo of rubber (for feromonal mixture) imprisoned in the vertical frame or the glue in the base horizon, thus being satisfied trap TL properly said.The way of setting of the equipment (trap) is I practice and fast, is enough to place in the vertical frame a hang of setting (plastic wire, lace, ribbon, others), which allows that Trap TL is hung in diverse places (stakes wooden, handles of brooms, pole of bamboo and/or fibre glass) or in the proper sugar cane-of-sugar.The trap can also be located directly on the ground or a horizontal base, with heights varied in function of the growth of the sugar cane. io To present trap is sufficiently compact, does not interfere with the daily one of the farming (manual works and with heavy machines), strictly leads and dismountable, has seen that the panels of yellow color with glue are easily removable, which can be duly substituted in the place where the trap was located, what it returns economic and very durable trap TL. Beyond the epigrafadas praticidades above, the alluded trap quickly can be mounted and dismounted without the employment of special tools.The above-mentioned equipment (trap TL) can be set in the field in some heights and distances inside (of the canavial) and later which coped for the edge, to fight the insect.In the morning, in sunny days, for return of the 09h30min to the 12h00min the adults in flights in the canavial settle in such a way in the trap in the horizontal panel (in the base) as in the vertical panel.The presence of the luminosity of the sun is important for the activity of the butterfly in the canavial.After the 12h30min the adults remain motionless with short and occasional flights, and are registered landing of the adults of T. /icus licus in the traps.Male as in such a way female they settle in the traps, with the number of males better than the one of females.In some cultures, the presence of the 6 (six) or most adult ones glued together in the glue, in an only week, already is an indication of infestation.In general, in the previous state of the technique the producer needs to wait that a certain percentage of sugar cane is attacked to initiate the control, what with certainty cause losses in the culture, beyond incurring an reverse speed-infestation.With the method of Trap TL, the producer only needs to verify it daily, enters the 09h30min to the 12h00min. To present invention, beyond avoiding losses, it hinders that an reverse speed-infestation happens, therefore the insects do not mate, and same that some female remains outside of the trap, is reduction of the male adults in the canavial, having as which did not fertilize female consequences, diminishing considerably the probability of a new infestation.To present invention better it could be understood referring the attached figures, that also contain numerical references altogether with the detailed description, without, however to restrict its configuration how much its dimensions, ratio and applicability.
In accordance with these numerical figures and its references, to present io pioneer patent mention to an equipment (trap) for capture of insects of the Castniidae family (Telchin licus licus) of the Lepidoptera order (butterflies of great transport), among others insects, characterized to be constituted by a base conformed for two frames of sustentation a vertical line (1) and another horizontal line (2), both conforming in pipes and connections of 20 PVC of mm, caibro, wood and others, connected between itself by means of rabbet or bolts (3), making angle of 90 degrees (4).In the composed base for the frames vertical (1) and horizontal line (2), yellows, duly removable are connected of form continues panels (5), as well as, one septo (6) of rubber for feromonal mixture, installed in the vertical frame (1) or the glue in the base horizon (2).In the top of the vertical structure (1) a hang (7) of consisting setting of wire can be installed, plastic lace or ribbon, which allows that Trap TL is hung in pole (8) of sustentation, constituted in wood, metal, handles of brooms, pole of bamboo and/or fibre glass.

Field of the Invention
The present invention involves system for the [monitoramento] and control of the drill of the floral grain stalk of the coconut palm, [Homalinotus] coriaceus understanding a composition I contend the specific [feromonio]. The system uses the composition disposed in the interior of traps, Sendo these distributed in the plantation of coconut palms, for posterior withdrawal of the insects.
Antecedents of the Invention and Previous Technique
[Homalinotus] coriaceus is an insect of the order Coleopter, [Curculionidae] family, known as drill of the floral grain stalk, that is fed of the flower of the coconut palm and of I scratch new, provoking its precocious fall e, consequently, a reduction in the production of I scratch (Coconuts [nucifera]). This plague is more frequent in the dwarfed coconut palm, factor this that [desmotiva] the producers to the culture of the same.Species of the South American continent, Sendo observed in [cultivos] of I scratch of the littoral region above the parallel 20.deg. and in places of the interior with inferior altitude to 800 meters.It Occurs in Argentina and, in Brazil, the States of Amazon, Par3a, [Paraiba], [Pernambuco], [Alagoas], [Sergipe], Bahia, Spirit

During its development, as much the adult individual how much the larva, through its I inhabit to feed, provoke damages to the coconut palm.The adults lacerate the fabric of flourish and new fruits and the larvae make galleries in the floral grain stalk.The beetles of the masculine sex liberate the [feromonio] of aggregation, attracting male and female, that feed themselves and mate.The [ovoposita] female preferentially in the floral grain stalk or the internal face of the [foliar] sheath.After more or less 10 days, the larva erupts and penetrates in the floral grain stalk, where it is fed and [formando] is developed the galleries.In this phase, the larva removes staple fibers of the base of [peciolo] foliar or the floral grain stalk and fabrics most superficial of [estipe], to weave its cocoon and if a track in superficial form of ridge of up to 80 to change in pupa, leaving length [mm]. This hard training close to 144 days.The adults develop themselves from the pupae during days and live close to 665 days (NECKING, F. B.; [CROCOMO], W. B.; BLACKSMITH, J. M. S.

Although not to have register in the Ministry of Cattle Agriculture e
Supplying of insecticide for this plague (MAP, 2012. Ministry of Cattle Agriculture and Supplying. www.agrofit.agricultura.dov.br.Access in 20/02/2012), many farmers use the chemical control, through quarterly spraying of the plant attacked with chemical products the base of
[Malation](R) to 50% or [Metilparation](R) to 60%. Such forms of control are not efficient, therefore the larvae stay sheltered and far from the action of these products.Moreover, most of the time, this spraying is accomplished of inadequate form, SEM orientation and with staff not trained, what it generates diverse health problems to the applicator, and environmental problems, as: pollution of the ground, the phreatic sheet, of rivers and lakes, as well as the destruction of beneficial fauna, surge of secondary plagues, establishment of resistance, beyond raising the production costs.
Therefore, the search of alternative and ecologically correct methods would be an alternative in the combat of this plague.In this context, the use of [semioquimicos], especially [feromonios], comes appearing as alternative viable in the control of plagues.Until the present moment it has 27 [feromonios] registered in the MAP
(MAP, 2012. Ministry of Cattle Agriculture and Supplying. www.agrofit.agricultura.gov.br.Access in 20/02/2012), seven are for coleopters and of these, only one, is employed in the control of plagues of the culture of the coconut palm, [rincoforol], [feromonio] of aggregation of the drill of the eye of the coconut palm.
[Feromonios] is chemical, liberated substances for a species, that interfere with the behavior of another individual, always of the same species.These behaviors can be: sexual, aggregation, track, alarm, funeral among others. ([VILELA], E. F.; [LUCIA], T. M. C. D. [Feromonios] of insects:

Summary of the Invention
The present invention is referring to a system for control and [monitoramento] of the drill of the floral grain stalk of the [coriaceus] Homalinotus coconut palm, understanding a formulation and device to attract and to capture the insect.
The formulation of the composition capable is divulged to attract the drill of the floral grain stalk and method of use to promote its [monitoramento]. In regards to this drill, the composition includes identical a synthetic [feromonio] to produced for males, the composition formed for (1R-2S) - 1-Methyl (1-metiletenil) [ciclobutanoetanol], (Z) - 2- (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) ethanol, (E) - (3,3 - [dimetilciclohexilideno]) acetaldehyde, (Z) - (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) acetaldehyde, that can be used will attract male and female adult individuals, thus accomplishing its [monitoramento] and control in the cultures of [palmaceas].
invention proposes the specific formulation of a composition contends the [feromonio] for the drill of the floral grain stalk and in such a way to contribute to reduce the populations of the same, diminishing the actual damages for the use of insecticides.It Reduces the production costs, for the reduction of the use of [agrotoxicos], and consequently, increasing the edges of profit of the producer.It Supplies subsidies that can guide the producer in the decision taking how much to the application of insecticides and to I cope it cultural, when will be necessary, resulting in product with little chemical residue, of bigger acceptability and greater market price.Until the present moment, only one plague of the coconut palm, the R. [palmarum], had its identified [feromonio]. In such a way, the present invention has as objective to minimize the actual damages for the plagues of [palmaceas], between them of the coconut palm, important TAO culture mainly north-eastern Brazilian, whom it detains close to 75% of national production ([IBGE]. [Levant]. [Sistem]. [Prod]. [Agric]. Monthly Research of forecast and accompaniment of the agricultural harvests in the calendar year.Rio de Janeiro. 24, 01, 1-80, 2011).
Detailed Description of the Invention
The present invention describes the composition, a device and a method for control of the drill of the floral grain stalk.
The described composition can be used in program of control of population of the drill of the floral grain stalk during its phase of adult.One programs cash of control can reduce the total number of applications of insecticides, the necessary in the production, and create favourable conditions for the elimination of the drill, important plague in the culture of [palmaceas]. Such program can reduce the destruction of beneficial insects and contribute to the eradication of the drill of the floral grain stalk in [agrossistemas] of [palmaceas].
Composition
With respect to the drill of the floral grain stalk, the four components of the [feromonio] of detected specific males in the chromatographic analysis were:
(1R-2S) - 1-Methyl (1-nnetiletenil) [ciclobutanoetanol] ([grandlure] I), (Z) - 2- (3,3 - [dimetilciclohexilideno]) ethanol ([grandlure] II), (E) - (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) acetaldehyde ([grandlure] III), (Z) - (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) acetaldehyde ([grandlure] IV).
The present invention mentions a composition to it with [feromonal] activity understanding the combination of four composites identified in the composition of the [feromonio] of aggregation of H. [coriaceus] and an agriculturally acceptable vehicle.
to be a known and used product already in the control of other plagues, the synthetic routes of four composites sufficiently are known.The composites can be commercially obtained and chemical preparations according to specific composition for this insect.
In respect to the formulation of the [feromonio], it represents preferentially enters
(0,1-20%), (0,1-20%), (0,1-10%) e (0,1-10%) of [Grandlure] I, II, III and IV
respectively, plus a vehicle in the ratio of 1-40%, that it can be inert a mineral or vegetal oil.The vehicle plays a fundamental role in the composition, to diminish the speed of evaporation of the [feromonal] mixture, increasing its durability.It Has its effectivity in doses approach of
500mg 700mg of this product for trap, with durability of close to 90 days.This formulation can be used in plastic capsule of cylindrical form, with capacity to be stored of 0,1 to 1,5 [mL] of the product.Trap I contend the composition
The plastic capsule I contend the composition can be conditioned in a trap, as usually used for another drill of the coconut palm, the drill of the eye of the coconut palm (NAVARRESE, D. M, of A. F.; MYRTLE, M. M. E.;

The used trap can be of the type bucket with cover, prepared using a bucket of 10 50L, Sendo the cover opened for one to four orifices, through which they can be boxed an inverted funnel in each, whose extremities of lesser dimension are enough to leave to enter the certain plague.In this region of the trap, prey the cover, is placed a plastic capsule contends the composition [feromonal], being able or [not] serperfurada an only time in the central region of the cover of the capsule.In each trap they can be used attractive alimentary, the adjuvant ones, that they consist of pieces of [colmo] of sugar sugar cane, of approximately cm to 40 cm, or rinds of I scratch green, cut and placed in the traps.
adjuvant it has the paper it keep the plague in the interior of the trap.Method
The buckets must preferentially be placed in the edges of the plantation, in the ratio of a bucket for each 1 to 2 hectares.To each 15 days, she becomes exchange of the sugar cane of sugar and, to each 2 months, the exchange of the [feromonal] composition.
The insects collected during this period must manually be died.Amongst the method of behavioral control through the [feromonio] use, the form of use of the [feromonal] composition proposal, the one that must be used is the [monitoramento] and controls effective of the plague for [massal] collection, in view of that the used [feromonio] is of aggregation and attracts male and female.
Through the [monitoramento] it is possible to determine the presence or population absence of determined species of plague in a predefined area, what it comes to assist to the producer in taking of decisions on the better form of I cope of this plague.
The [feromonal] composition proposal in this document can be used in combination with other [feromonios], as [rincoforol], for example.
Example 1 - Attainment of the natural extract and identification of the components
Collection of the insects - the adult insects were collected in producing areas of scratch in the States of [Alagoas], Bahia and [Sergipe], Brazil, Sendo lead to the [LPqRN], conditioned in plastic deposits (10,0 30,0 x x 45,0 cm) perforated keep ventilation, kept in chamber with temperature of 27 2.deg.C, relative humidity of 70% 5 and one [fotoperiodo] inverted of 12 hours.The used diet was [mesocarpo] of scratches green, changed it to each three days according to methodology developed for the [Embrapa] Coastal Trays (NECKING, F. B.; WILSON B. C.; BLACKSMITH, J. M. S.; [ARAUJO], R. P. C.;
[LABINAS]. the M. [Feeding] Substrates you the [Black] Coconut Bunch Weevil, [Homalinotus] coriaceus ([Gyllenhal]) (Coleopter: [Curculionidae]), [Rearing] in Laboratory. [Neotropica] Entomology, v. 34, P. 3451-457, 2005).
Attainment of extracts - Groups of 100 adult male insects of unknown age were separate, transferred to extraction chambers, that were constituted of glass enclosure for bullfighting (0 250 [mm]), lined with paper filter and kept in the same conditions of the creation.After 24 hours, the paper filter I contend you excrete them was removed of the chamber, placed in glass flask with 2,0 methanol [mL] degree [HPLC], and kept for more 24 hours in freezer ***-18.deg.C. After that, the solvent, reduced to 500,0 was extracted [pL] in tenuous gaseous nitrogen flow and kept ***-18.deg.C for analysis for Gaseous Chromatography connected to the Spectrometry of Massa ([CG]-EM) and behavioral tests.Analytical Procedures - an aliquot one of 1,0 [pL] of the obtained extract was injected in the way ""[splitless]"" in a chromatograph the gas connected to the spectrometer of masses (70 [CG]-EM) [eV] ([El]), of the mark [Shimadzu], model
Equipped [QP] 5050 with a capillary column [DB]-5 (30,0 m x 0,25 [mm] x 0,25 p.m.) ([J]&W Scientific, [Folson], California) and Helium as gas of drags to 1 [mUmin], initial temperature of 30.deg.C, with a slope of heating and final temperature of 280.deg.C, the detector (250.deg.C) and injector (180.deg.C).
Structural Identification - the composites were identified by means of the standard of spalling, time of retention and similarity with available composites in the database of [CG]-EM ([WILEY]229LIB). All the proposed composites identified were confirmed through comparison with synthetic standards in the same conditions of analysis.
From the chromatographic profile of the active extract obtained of excrementss of males and [coriaceus] females of H. it was possible specifically to verify the presence of four composites produced for males.These four composites were identified as ((1R-2S) - 1-Methyl (1-metiletenil) [ciclobutanoetanol]
([grandlure] I), (Z) - 2- (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) ethanol ([Grandlure] II), (E) - (3,3 - [dimetilciclohexilideno]) acetaldehyde ([grandlure] III), (Z) - (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) acetaldehyde ([grandlure] IV)
The specters of masses and the time of retention of the present chemical constituents in [coriaceus] extracts of H. were compared with the synthetic standards [Grandlure] I, II, III and IV, which are available commercially.Example 2 - Behavioral Test
[Olfatometro] with laminar air flow was used one, consisting basically of rheostat [1], [microfan] ([to] cooler) [2], filter of active coal [3], resistance chamber [4], laminating screen of the air flow (weaveeed [voil]) [5] and an enclosure for bullfighting [6], that it consists of a rectangular box (50,0 x 40,0 x 10,0 cm), coated for removable glass plate priorly [abrasada], opened in the two extremities Sendo one stamped with the laminating screen and in the superior part, was placed a square-lined transparency (1x1 cm) making possible the direct comment and the register of the way of the insect [7] (Figure 2). The [feromonio] is liberated in the point [8] in order to attract the insect in this direction.The method is based on [referencia] bibliographical known ([MENDON]ÇA, F. B. C., [VILELA], E. F., [EIRAS]. the E., [SANT]'ANA. E. G. Answer of [Cosmopolites] sordidus
([Germar]) (Coleopter: [Curculionidae]) to volatile of the plant the hostess and [coespecificos] adults in [olfatometro]. it Search Brazilian of.Zoology, 16, 123-128, 1999).
They were used [bioensaios] with extracts of males with 500,0 volumes of [pL]
e 1,000, 0 [pL] in paper of filter with 0 1 cm Used 20 repetitions for males and females, Sendo used an insect per minute for each repetition.
insect was placed in the way of the enclosure for bullfighting, receiving a continuous air flow with 0,1 [mi]/s. Before each experiment, the equipment was calibrated using only solvent and accomplished a considered test reference.
The [bioensaios] had had beginning in [escotofase], the temperature of 27 2.deg.C and relative humidity of 70% 5. It Was Considered as positive answer (+) the aiming of the insects since the way of the enclosure for bullfighting (initial point) until the source of stimulus, next the laminating screen, and as negative answer (-), the aiming for any other point of the enclosure for bullfighting.After each test, the system was clean with alcohol to 70% and left in functioning to remove possible odors in the enclosure for bullfighting.To facilitate the visualization, was used a red light bulb of 15 W. With intention to verify the conditions of the air pen, was made the test of smoke before each experiment, that consists of the comment of smokes generated of the reaction of steams them of acidifies [cloridrico] and ammonia hydroxide ([EIRAS]. the E.; GRANDSON. the M. applied [Ofatometria] to the study of the behavior of insects. 3, PP. 27-39.

After the execution of the experiments with natural extract, was accomplished tests with standard of the identified [feromonio]: (1R-2S) - 1-Methyl (1-metiletenil) [ciclobutanoetanol] ([grandlure] I), (Z) - 2- (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) ethanol
([grandlure] II), (E) - (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) acetaldehyde ([grandlure] III), (Z) - (3,3-dimetilciclohexilideno) acetaldehyde ([grandlure] IV)). The 10 tests were accomplished using [pL] of the solution to 1, 10, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 [ppm]. The results obtained in the [bioensaios] were analyzed using analysis distribution free through the test of the squared [Qui] ([P]<0,01). The experimental delineation entirely [was] casualizado.
The concentration most efficient of the synthetic [feromonio] was to 1,000 [ppm], while of natural extract [pL] was in doses of 1.000. This proved the attractive effect of the synthetic [feromonio], in both the [sexos], of significant form.

Descriptive Report for pioneer patent: COMPOSITION [FARMA]- CEUTICA OF [NANOPARTiCULAS] OF SILVER IN [COPAIBA] OIL STOPS
BACTERICIDAL MEDICATION PREPARATION [CICATRIZANTE] AND/OR
Field of the Invention
The present invention deals with a composition understanding [nanoparticulas] of silver incorporated in vegetal oils, as the pure oil of [copaiba] or in formulations (lotion, cremates, ointment and gel), for use as [cicatrizante] and bactericidal, aiming at to speed up the process of [cicatrizacao] of cutaneous wounds.The referred to composition can be used in the areas medical, pharmaceutical, odontologic and veterinary medicine.
State of the Technique and Antecedents
Pele serves as a protective barrier against agents of the environment, and the loss of the cutaneous integrity and the absence of an appropriate repair can provide serious to systemic deficiencies or same the death.The [cicatrizacao] is a process repair salary that after occurs injury unchained for stimuli of different natures.The [cicatrizacao] occurs in three phases:
proliferation, inflammation and remodelling.Thus, the wounds demand intensive cares with the [antissepsia] and clinical [monitoramento], aiming at to avoid bacterial growth, fabric training of exuberant granulation and excessive retraction of the scar.The possibility to be interfered positively with the [cicatricial] process can mean a profit in the quality of life of the patients, beyond reduction of cost in the dismissed cares and the improvement of the final quality of the regenerative process.Although available medication for the treatment of cutaneous wounds, the cost and the adverse reactions to the patient to exist are revealed as factors that limit the use of the same.
The treatments of the cutaneous injuries include the medication use in different types of formulations, such as after, lotions, you cremate, [geis], folders, ointments, spray, aerosols, Independent etc. of the type of medication, the treatment of the injuries has great clinical importance, due to the time of resolution, caused discomfort and necessity of daily cares that present.Moreover, the available medication have irritation potential the drawn out periods of exhibition, and also limitation of access to the products for the high price.
Amongst available medication, they are cited most used for [cicatrizacao] of cutaneous wounds: a) [Fibrase](R): it is indicated in the treatment of cutaneous injuries, such as burnings, you fester and wounds, in which it presents pair action, as [debridante] agent and antibiotic topic.For this medication already cases of [hipoplasia] of bone marrow were told, including [aplastica] anemia and death. b) [Dermazine](R): it possesses in its composition [Sulfadiazina] de Prata 1% [micronizada] with action mechanism on the cellular membrane and microbian cellular wall, promoting the weakness of these, with consequent disruption of the cell, being there its bactericidal effect.As vanity its can be highlighted little absorption in human fabrics, beyond, when used in very extensive areas of corporal surface, the [monitoracao] of the [sericos] levels of Sulfa drug and the renal function becomes important.In addition, some of the usually seen adverse reactions with systemic sulfonamide (syndrome of Stevens-Johnson, syndrome of [Lyell], [driscrasia] and [cristaluria]) can occur during therapy with [Dermazine](R), even so rare, depending on the percentage of corporal surface where [Dermazine](R) is applied and the depth of the fabric injured.
The present invention is presented as alternative product to these medication, resultant of the [nanotecnologia] association and [fitoterapia].
The proposal a product that jointly uses the [cicatrizantes] effects of the oil of [copaiba] ([Copaifera] ssp) and bactericidal of the [nanoestruturada] silver mentions to it.This association is the differential of the present invention, since previous applications only use one of the components, as displayed in documents of deposit of the patents:

Summary of the Invention
The present invention deals with a composition contends [nanoparticulas] of silver dispersed in an oil, preferentially oil of [copaiba] ([Copaifera] ssp), presenting jointly the [cicatrizantes] effects of the bactericidal oil of [copaiba] and of the [nanoestruturada] silver.The results of epithelial [cicatrizacao] with the application of the composition proposal had presented a synergic effect, better than the isolated effects of two substances, and also to the ones of commercial medication.The generated composition can be presented in the form of the proper pure oil of [copaiba] with [nanoparticulas] of silver dispersed or enclosed in formulations, in the soap forms, it cremates, ointment and gel.Also in formulations to absorb dressings.It Can in general be used in animals and human beings (adult, children and [gestantes]).
Description of the Figures
Histological Analysis of the wound made possible to evaluate the quality of the [cicatrizacao] process.Figures 1 and 2 after show to the histology of the wounds the treatment with saline solution (1), oil of [copaiba] (2), [nanoparticulas] of silver ([NanoAg]) (3), [nanoparticulas] of silver in [copaiba] (4) or [Dermazine] (5) in 9.deg. day after the injury.The results of the [histopatologico] examination are summarized in Table 1.
The [histopatologica] analysis of wounds dealt with physiological serum (saline) totally demonstrates a disorganized epidermis.Moreover, a lesser [epitelizacao] is also observed, as well as a lesser conjunctive fabric deposition in the group of animals dealt with salt mine (Figure 1 and 2).Areas of [tecidual] degeneration, necrosis and to the persistence of inflammatory [exsudatos] in the superior [derme] was observed, together with a loss of the epidermis (arrows).In comparison, the treated infected wounds with [CO] or [NanoAg] showed a lesser text of [necroticas] areas of what those dealing with isolated saline solution (Figure 1 and 2).
The animals dealt with [NanoAgCO] or the medication of reference
[Dermazine](R), on the other hand, showed attenuation in the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the increased proliferation of [fibroblastos] (arrows).In the treatment with [NanoAgCO] it had a complete reverse speed-epitelizacao, resulting in a well organized epidermis (*), comparable to the one of the Pele normal adjacent, who was not involved in the generation of wounds and [cicatrizacao] (Figure 1 and 2).The wounds dealt with [NanoAgCO] had demonstrated to an improved training of the epidermis and the fabric deposition conjunctive, when comparative with the other groups (Figure 1 and 2).
Description of the technique
A preferential form of preparation of the dispersion of [nanoparticulas] of silver was accomplished through the nitrate reduction of silver with the citrate of alone [dio], as told for [Nath] & [Chilkoti] ([NATH] N., [CHILKOTI]., 2002. Anal [Chem]. 74:504-509) e, after that, made the dispersion in oil of [copaiba], as described will follow it.One gram of [AgNO]3 was dissolved in 100 extreme and warm [deionizada] pure water [mL], remaining under vigorous agitation during the heating.After to reach the ebullition point, quickly added 1,5 [mL] of 0,13 M of sodium citrate.During the process of ebullition of [solu]- dog, kept per 10 minutes, the color of the solution moved for ash.The solution was left to cool until the ambient temperature, continuing to be agitated.After the cooling, was taken the centrifugalization to 12,000 [rpm] during 15 minutes.
This procedure was repeated diverse times until the attainment of 1mg of [nanoparticulas] of powder silver.After a drying process low the pressure (around 10 -2 Par3a), 1 MG of the resulting dust was mixed in 100 [mL]
of oil of [copaiba] and submitted the [ultrassonicas] waves during close to 1 h.
dispersion of [nanoparticulas] in the oil was observed using the technique of electronic microscopy of transmission.
The incorporation of [nanoparticulas] of silver in oil of [copaiba] can occur for different methods, including [sputtering], chemical and mechanical method.The method [sputtering] allows the generation of the product in industrial scale.
The generated composition can be presented in pure oil of [copaiba] or in formulations, in the soap forms, it cremates, ointment and gel.Also in formulations to absorb dressings.
It Can in general be used in animals and human beings (adult, children and [gestantes]).
Example 1
Tests of [cicatrizacao] in 20 mice were accomplished ([Mus] muscu/us), divided in five groups of 4 animals.Each group received the application from different products, Sendo that group 1, control, received saline solution [NaCI] to 0.9%, group 2 received the application from oil from [copaiba] CO, group 3
it only received [nanoparticula] from powder silver, group 4 [nanoparticula] of dispersed silver in oil of [copaiba] and the 5 group [Dermazine](R).
The animals were numbed with ether and had had the [pelagem] scraped before the induction of the wound.Using surgical blade, a wound (1,6 cm of diameter) was induced in the Pele dorsal of the animals, that were kept individually in the bird cages and with the displayed wounds.For the infection the [cepa] of [Staphylococcus] aureus ([ATCC] 25923) to 108 [CFU] was used ([Colony] Forming Unit). All the animals had topically received (200 [pl]) from the treatments a time to the day per nine days consecutive, initiating in the day of the induction of the wound.The animals dealt with [Dermazine](R) had topically received a time to day 0,5 g from the ointment.The [cicatrizacao] in the area of the wound was monitored and measured for camera in the times: 3.deg., 6.deg. and 9.deg. day.
Group 4, that [nanoparticula] received the treatment from dispersed silver in oil of [copaiba] ([NanoAgCO]), presented as resulted, in respect to the other groups, an increase in the area reconstituted in all the times, reducing significantly the [cicatrizacao] time.
The effect of [nanoparticula] of dispersed silver in oil of [copaiba] (Nano
[AgCO]) on the contraction and the [cicatrizacao] of wounds infected in rats was analyzed on the basis of two different methods:
1) The gauging of the area of the wound opened in respect to the inflicted original wound in the end of 3.deg., 6.deg. and 9.deg. day, e
2) An evaluation of the [histopatologicas] modifications in the fabric of the closed wound in the ninth day after the beginning of the treatment.
Table 1 summarizes the processes of closing of wounds infected, observed for the different treatments, showing the area of the wound in days 3, 6 and 9.
Table 1. Effect of the treatments in the area of infected wounds Treatment:: Parameters: Area of the wound in the days, cm 2:: Period of [Epiteliza]- Epiteliza- dog (in days): 3:: 6:: 9:
Saline Solution:: 1,59:: 1,38:: 1,17:: 17,50:: 1,61:: 1,27:: 0,90:: 17,50 [NanoAg]:: 1,58:: 1,22:: 0,92:: 17,00 [NanoAgCO]:: 1,44:: 1,00:: 0,44:: 12,50 [Dermazine](R):: 1,53:: 1,18:: 0,71:: 15,00
The animals dealt with the [NanoAgCo] had presented a contraction of the wound, in respect to the initial area of continuity, of 28% on the 3rd, 50% on the 6th and 78% on the 9th, representing resulted superior, in all the times, of the obtained ones with Saline Solution, oil of [copaiba], [nanoparticulas] of silver and [Dermazine](R). In the [P]11015731-0 document the use of [fibrase](R) is told, with a contraction in the wound of 74% to the 9 days.
After the topical application of a saline solution in infected wounds, the area contraction of the wound was of 20,5% in respect to its original size (2 cm 2) on the 3rd, 31% on the 6th, and of 41,5% on the 9th. The wound completely finished closed around 17.deg. day.The animals dealt with [NanoAg] had shown a fee of contraction of the wound, of 21% on the 3rd, 39% on the 6th and 54% to day 9, in respect to its original size.A profile of similar [cicatrizacao] was observed with the animals dealt with [CO]. The area of the wound was reduced in 19,5% on the 3rd, of 36,5% on the 6th, and 55% on the 9th. The wound dealt with [NanoAg] or [CO] showed a period of [epitelizacao] of close to 17
days.
The application of the pure oil of [copaiba] did not produce any significant improvement on the use [NanoAg]; the closing of the [mensurado] wound after 9 days was of 55% for the pure oil of [copaiba] and 54% for [NanoAg], respectively.Still, the fee of contraction of the wound of the reference medication
[Dermazine](R) was lower of what the proposed [NanoAgCO], 64,5% and 41%, 23,5% Sendo on the 3rd on the 6th, on the 9th. It Was Noticed that the rats dealt with the [NanoAgCO] had demonstrated a closing of the considerably sped up wound enter the after-surgical times of 6 and 9 days, with an average period of [epitelizacao] of only 12,5 days.The [NanoAgCO] surpasses the compared treatments clearly, including the [Dermazine](R) reference.
Example 2
The histological analysis of the wound made possible to evaluate the quality of the [cicatrizacao] process.Figures 1 and 2 after show to the histology of the wounds the treatment with saline solution (physiological serum), oil of [copaiba] (CO), [nanoparticulas] of silver ([NanoAg]), [nanoparticulas] of silver in [copaiba] ([NanoAg]- CO) or [Dermazine](R) in 3.deg. and 9.deg. day after the injury (Table 1).
The [histopatologica] analysis of wounds dealt with physiological serum ([solu]- saline dog) totally demonstrates a disorganized epidermis.Moreover, a lesser [epitelizacao] is also observed, as well as a lesser conjunctive fabric deposition in the group of animals dealt with saline solution (Figure
2). Areas of [tecidual] degeneration, necrosis and persistence of inflammatory [exsudatos] in the superior [derme] were observed, together with a loss of the epidermis.In comparison, the treated infected wounds with [CO] or [NanoAg] had shown a lesser text of [necroticas] areas of what those dealing with isolated saline solution (1) (Figure 1).

It Is a polymer with applicable characteristics in some sectors of activities.Amongst the diverse applications of the [quitosana] they highlight its use in the medical area, as vehicle for the controlled release of drugs, as dressings and as agent antimicrobials.
deposit of clear W3O 01/76562 tells the use of [quitosana] microcrystalline in form of grains or [pellets] for the controlled release of medication for use saw verbal.The deposit of clear W3O 2012/044263 cites the use of [quitosana] in diverse forms, as colloidal suspension, nano and [microspheres], for release of fragrances, while deposit W3O 2009/092333 proposes an equipment for production of [microspheres] of [quitosana] and [alginato] of sodium.Request W3O
2008/028264 describe a process of attainment of [microcapsules] contend magnetic properties for release of drugs contend [alginato] or [quitosana].
In agriculture, a use of the [quitosana] says respect to the development of supports for immobilization of [biomoleculas]. The polymer can be used as raw material in the development of membranes, filters and [microspheres], which can be used in diverse branches of the agricultural biotechnology ([Guibal], E. [Heterogeneous] Material [Catalysis] on Chitosan-Based: the [Review]- Prog. [Polym]. [Sci]., 30, 71 - 109. 2005). Clear US 6.365.189 describes a method of controlled release of [feromonio] using [microsphere] of synthetic or natural polymers, between these, the [quitosana], using a differentiated system, with a second layer.Another patent, the US
4.439.488 describe the involvement of the [microencapsulation] of [feromonio] with dissolved biological agent and dispersed in a watery solution of a polymer I polished-hidroxilado gel [formador]. Already request [CN] 102180739 describes the controlled fertilizer release using straw of rice or wheat and [quitosana]. The Japanese patent [S]60-252403 describes a method of encapsulation of material for spraying, of slow release of [feromonio] obtained for [emulsificacao] and co-polymerization.Other patents, as the Japanese
[H]-9-1244-08, uses synthetic resin or inorganic substances for the controlled release of [biomoleculas].
The preparation of [beads] or [microspheres] is a strategy to develop the capacity of [adsorcao] of the [quitosana], once the [microspheres] possess a superficial area close to 100 times bigger of what the [quitosana] in flakes.Moreover, the faster [microspheres] present kinetic of [adsorcao] e bigger easiness of handling and operation.However, it is important to consider that the molecular weight and the degree of [desacetilacao] of the [quitosana] substantially influence the training of the [microspheres]. Diverse methods developed for the production of [microspheres] not always are [reprodutiveis] for [quitosanas] with distinct characteristics.In such a way, the type of the [quitosana] used in the process influences the size and the morphology of obtained [microspheres] ([GUIBAL], E.; [SATRE].; RUIZ, M. PDD [and] Pt Recovery Using Chitosan Gel [Beads]. I. [Influence] of the Drying Process on Diffusion
[Properties]. [Separation] Science and Technology, 37 (9) 2143-216. 2002).
The preparation of [microspheres] of [quitosana] can be accomplished reacting polymer with controlled amounts of [multibrave] anions, resulting in a series of connections [intercruzadas] between polymers.The crossed connections can be obtained in way acidify, basic or neutral, depending on the applied method.The [microspheres] of [quitosana] can be prepared by some methods such as: connections [intercruzadas] for [anions], precipitation, training of complexes, modified emulsion and [ionotropica] gelatinizacao.The [intercruzadas] connections can be obtained by chemical precipitation, using [glutaraldeido] or with heat use.The technique of connections crossed between polymers affects the [mucoadesiva] capacity of [microspheres] s (([RORRER], G. L.; [HSIEN], [T]-Y.; [WAY], J. D. [Synthesis] of Porous-Magnetic Chitosan Beads will be [Removal] of Cadmium lons from Waste Water. Industrial. [Engineering] Chemistry Research, 32, 2170-2178. 1993).
The three main methodologies employed for the attainment of [microspheres] of [quitosana] with controlled dimensions are: i) For coagulation, in which the [quitosana] is dissolved in way acidifies and dripped in alkaline solution for training of the [microspheres]; the [entrecruzamento] is after executed the attainment and neutralization of the [microspheres]; ii) For inversion of phases, Sendo the [microspheres] obtained in situ for the dissolution of the [quitosana] in way I acidify I contend the [entrecruzamento] agent and dispersion of the watery phase in an oily phase so as to obtain insoluble materials e, iii) For the technique of [spraydrying], in which the [quitosana] is dissolved in way acidifies and to this solution a [reticulante] agent is added.This last one is the faster technique and perhaps more it needs the three cited.The technique simplest is, without a doubt, of coagulation in alkaline way for the [polissacarideo] dripping dissolved it in acidifies ([HE], P.; DAVIS, S. S.; [ILLUM]; L. [Sustained] Release Chitosan Microspheres Prepared by Novel Spray [Drying] Methods, [Journal] of Microencapsulation, 16, 343-355. 1999). [Biocompativeis] and biodegradable Polymers are highly desirable composites for the confection of micron and [nanoesferas] conjugated or incorporated with other active components.The [quitosana] presents [biocompatibilidade] and biodegradability amongst other particular properties, that allow its manipulation in watery way acidify in order to lead the training of micron or [nanoesferas] conjugated with composites where it is desired to make a release slow, controlled or even though to increase the efficiency of the active substance absorption ([RORRER], G. L.; [HSIEN], [T]-Y.; [WAY], J. D. [Synthesis] of Porous-Magnetic Chitosan Beads will be [Removal] of Cadmium lons from Waste Water. Industrial. [Engineering] Chemistry Research, 32, 2170-2178. 1993). This technology of [dispensacao] presents promising alternative to liberating of [feromonio] the conventional ones and in current use.
The instability of molecules of [feromonios] under the solar radiation makes with that this system becomes costly in the farming, once the farmer will have to make the material exchange more frequently.The study with the [quitosana] it consisted of the development of a methodology to control the release of the [feromonio] and to return it more steady.This [microencapsulamento] at the outset allows to active greater protection in respect to the solar radiation.To the applied being, the [feromonio] has greater time of life in the culture, what it represents one important economy for the farmer, whom it does not need to renew it of frequent TAO form.
The [feromonio] of the [Metamasius] hemipterus ([LINNAEUS], 1758) (COLEOPTER: [CURCULIONIDAE]) is constituted by the 4-Methyl composites [nonanol], 2-Methyl, 2-Methyl, 5-Nonanol, in a changeable relation of each component of 7:1: 1:1; 1:7: 1:1; 1:1: 7:1 and 1:1: 1:7 ([Tab]. 1). Already
the [feromonio] of the [Rinchophorus] palmarum already is known and used commercially.
These species-specific composites do not represent any adverse effect to the beneficial organisms and they do not generate any risk of resistance of the insect plague as observed with the insecticides.Because of its complex biological activity, its dispersion surrounding it to be protected or monitored needs an elaborated system of release that assures the control of biological active the volatile composition.Given to its complexity and demand for new products, mainly due to the advance of the agriculture and necessities of one it controls of plagues efficient and reduction in the use of [agrotoxicos], new [feromonios] and methods of release need to be developed, Sendo this focus of the clear present.
These molecules need to have a slow and controlled release, keeping the activity of [biomoleculas] for a period bigger time, either in the [monitoramento] either in control for any one of the used techniques.
Also they need to be protected of the degradation promoted for the rays ultraviolet and the oxygen.
The study with the [quitosana] it consisted of the development of a methodology to control the release of the [feromonio] and to return it more steady.
This [microencapsulamento] allowed a slow and controlled release with an efficient collection for a bigger period of time and gave a bigger at the outset active protection in respect to the solar radiation.To the applied being, the [feromonio] has greater time of life in the culture, what it represents one important economy for the farmer, whom it does not need to change it of frequent form.The concentration of the [feromonio] in the environment is more controlled and more efficient.The system tested for the control of the [Metamasius] was much more efficient of what that SEM the [quitosana] and [glutaraldeido], collecting 7687 insects M. [hemipterus] and 131 insects of another species, [Rhynchophorus] palmarum.In another experiment, the collection mass! it reduced the population of the insect and reduced the dissemination of disease associated with the insect, proving the effectivity of the proposed system.
Summary of the Invention
The liberating system of [feromonio] of the [Metamasius] hemipterus was based on research with [feromonios], that had environmentally provided to the tools for the control of form insects insurance, through the manipulation of the behavior of the insect.The importance of the methods based on [feromonio] is accentuated in view of the increasing problems associates with the use of conventional insecticides.However for a generalization of the use of the [feromonios], the application techniques must be more trustworthy and more economic.As support to make a system of controlled release of the [feromonio] of the [Metamasius] hemipterus, was chosen the [quitosana] combined with [glutaraldeido], which contributed to increase of the efficiency of the system.The [quitosana] is a biodegradable, [biocompativel] and [atoxico] [aminopolissacarideo], obtained from the alkaline [desacetilacao] of the [quitina] ([Guibal], 2005). Structurally, it is a copolymer formed for units 6 - (1--> 4) - 2-amino 2-desoxi-D-glucose and 8- (1--> 4) - 2-acetamide 2-desoxi-D-glucose, with groups amino and [hidroxila] primary or secondary, which can chemically be modified.For the safe performance and it accomplishes, the release of these substances must be of controlled form e, for in such a way, the [quitosana] was [reticulada] with [glutaraldeido] and showed to be efficient in the release and protection of the chemical integrity of the [feromonio].

A reduction of the porosity of the spheres Can be observed contends [glutaraldeido] in respect to the SEM spheres [glutaraldeido], as much for the ones of 1%
how much for the ones of 3%. This reduction if of the one due to the blockade of the pores in the surface of the support for [esterico] impediment of molecules of [glutaraldeido]. Already the density and the average ray of particles had gotten excited in accordance with the concentration of the gel of [quitosana] and addition of the [feromonios].
These spheres of [quitosana] with the [feromonio] are taken the field for the [monitoramento] and control of the plague.The formulation is prepared in a system of trap for the collection of the insects.The traps I contend the [feromonio] are disposed between 70 to 100 meters one of the other and the insect is collected weekly or of 5 in 5 days and eliminated.The used traps can be, for example, the traps type bucket.
EXAMPLE
EFFICIENCY OF [FEROMONIO] METAMASOL IN the CAPTURE OF the [Metamasius] hemipterus
In 45 days of exhibition of the traps in the plantation 4,054 adults of [Metamasius] were collected [hemipterus], number enough to consider the possible involvement of the species in the random dissemination of the called disease [resinose]. Also they were attracted and collected 129 adults of another species, insect R. [palmarum].
[Massal] Collection of M. [hemipterans] in the plantation - With the collection intensified in the plantation from August of 2009, the number of adults of M. [hemipterans] was reduced gradually to the measure that the adults, who procreated themselves in the field, were Sendo imprisoned.In the five subsequent months to the period of the [monitoramento], the fee of referring reduction to the number of captures was of 71,7%, 27.1%, 13.2%, 10.9% and 6.5% of the total of capture obtained in the period of [monitoramento] ([Fig]. 1). The disease that arrived to reach 15.5% of the plantation in 1.deg. year of the infection had its advance reduced in 2.deg. year when it presented an increase of only 2.2% of new cases ([Fig]. 2).
Experiment accomplished in 2011 shows the efficiency of the product with the capture of 7.687 individuals (M. [hemipterus]) in the period of 8 weeks and 131 individuals ([Rhynchophorus] palmarum) (Tables 3 and 4).In [tab]. 3 the numbers of insects captured in different sectors of the plantation are presented and in [Tab]. 4 the insects captured according to species are presented.In seventh and the eighth week it did not have capture of insects, being able to be presumed that the same were eliminated from the area of the plantation.

Field of Invention s Mentions present pioneer patent to it, inserted in the laboratorial medical area, to a system of viral [genotipagem] to identify and to classify the genotype of the virus [Papilomavirus] Humano ([HPV]), objectifying its effective use as disgnostic for treatment of diseases.
Antecedents of the Invention and Previous Technique [io] Os [Papilomavirus] Humanos ([HPV]) are virus of the [Papillomaviridae] family.
They infect epithelial cells and have the capacity to cause injuries in Pele or mucosae.They Cause diverse types of injuries as the common wart and the genital wart or [condiloma], known popularly as rooster crest.
The [Papilomavirus] Human in some types, variant subtypes and IS of one same type, depending of the similarity in the sequence on the [nucleotideos] Are Classified. Therefore, they exist in the present time more than 120 viral types of [HPV], described and classified in two groups: of high risk and of low [oncogenico] risk.
The frequent manifestation most characteristic and of the infection for [HPV] is the wart training, that is benign [hiperproliferativas] injuries, also designated for [papilomas], of where drift the name of the virus.However, different subtypes of [HPV] are responsible for preferential infection in different zones, Sendo capable to cause diverse [patologias]. One of the most preoccupying [patologias] associate to the [HPV] is the development of uterus col cancer.
In the present time, the diagnosis of the infections for [HPV] takes in account the data of the history of the patient, and is processed visually in charge of a professional with great abilities, above all for the way of physical and complementary examinations with the direct research it indirect virus or through the modifications provoked for the infection in the cells and the fabric.Amongst the techniques used for the diagnosis, they are highlighted:
[Papanicolau]: more common preventive examination.It does not detect the virus, but yes, the modifications that it can cause in the cells.
Inspection with I acidify ascetic to 5%: examination for evaluation of the uterine col with emphasis in the identification of precursory injuries of the cervical cancer.
[Colposcopia] and [Peniscopia]: examination made for a called device [colposcopio], that increases the power of vision of the doctor, allowing to identify the injuries in the vulva, vagina, col of the uterus and penis.
[Biopsia]: it consists of the removal of a sample of the weaveeed cells and/or of the organism for analysis.
Hybrid Capture: examination of molecular hybridization that detects, with high sensitivity and specificity, the [DNA] of the [HPV] in sample of brushed or [biopsia].
Reaction in chain of [polimerase] (PCR): examination of high sensitivity that consists of amplification of the target, that is, of the viral [DNA], and posterior hybridization.
Hybridization in situ: hybridization method that demonstrates to the viral [DNA] in the cell, having itself it chance of evaluation of the fabric or cellular smear, at the same time where the presence is evaluated or not of the virus.
Although the [supramencionados] methods fulfill its aims, it bears mentionning that the same adopt methodology of high complexity, beyond presenting limitations how much to the capacity of [genotipar] more than 120 types of known viruses already, needing the accomplishment some distinct examinations, thus causing, moroseness in the necessary diagnosis.

Detailed Description of the invention
The object of the present invention is practically dedicated the viral [genotipagem] of [Papiloma] Virus Humano ([HPV]), idealized with the purpose to implement the diagnosis [to] biomolecular of the [HPV], saw [algoritimo] genetic - GAC
- modified using digital or [to] scanner, [desmembrado] chamber in four phases, characterized for the methodology, below [epigrafada]:
[io] P phase - Confection of the [acrilamida] gel: it is based on modifications [PCR]-RFLP for identification of the viral types of the [HPV]. A fragment of 450pb (pairs of bases) of viral the [L]1 gene is amplified using depraved [oligonucleotideos] [MY]11 and [MY]09. For the enzymatic digestion ([RFLP]), 4Ong of the fragments of [DNA] of the virus, correspondent region L 1 IS (450pb), obtained of the amplifications for RCP, is submitted to the enzymatic digestion for the following [endonucleases]: [BamHI], [Ddel], [HaeIII], [Hinfl], [PstI], [RsaI] and [Sau]3AI. 5 units of each enzyme are used, and the 37 reactions are incubated to ***.deg.C during 24 hours.He Was proven experimentally that the use of these units of enzyme, in bigger concentration to the indicated one in literature (1 to 2 units) and with time of incubation better than the usual one (3 to 4 hours), it generated a gel with standard of well defined fragments.This is the necessary for the definition of the parameters of reading for the algorithm.After that [lpt] of blue of [bromofenol] (coloring the sugar base) interrupting the reactions is added and after that the solution is storaged 4.deg.C until the application in the gel.The fragments generated for the enzymatic digestion are submitted to [eletroforese] in gel of [poliacrilamida] to 8% to a voltage of 3V/cm. the application in the gel become in nine columns, Sendo the first one standard of molecular weight (100pb), in second a control not digested is used and in the others seven columns are placed seven enzymes.After that, the gel is flush using a modified methodology of coloration in silver nitrate.This methodology of coloration generates a characteristic contrast and fundamental it enters the fragments of the virus, making possible the reading for the genetic algorithm.Finally the [acrilamida] gel is conditioned between sheets of paper cellophane ([plastificacao]), before being submitted to the drying to the ambient temperature.
2 the Phase - Digitalization (photograph, [escaneamento] or another method of image recognition) and treatment of the image: The image used for reading of the algorithm is a gel of [acrimilamida] with the results of [eletroforese] [unidimensional] of the products of digestion of specific the viral [DNA] for [endonucleases] of restriction.The image of the gel can after be digitized or the [plastificacao] before and, after that, be introduced in the computer.
digitalization of the gel for introduction in the computer can be made through digital photograph, [to] scanner or for another mechanism of image recognition.The resolution of the image is not a critical factor, being able to have lesser values that 1 [Mega] Pixels with optimum results.The system opens the image of the gel in which IRA to work and the first step is to guarantee that this image is lined up with the system of cartesian axles, using the vertical axle as reference.The image is converted for white black color and, or more precisely, for ash tones and, after that, she is inverted for the negative.
3a Phase - Extraction of the data: So that the genetic algorithm accomplishes the [genotipagem] of the virus, the values of the concentrations of pairs of base, result of the enzymatic digestion, are extracted of the image.The extraction of these values is made of assisted form where the IRA usufructuary to select the areas where the markers meet.The first area to be selected is the scale or ruler, that is the first column of markers, to the left.The election must guarantee that all the markers are selected and must start always from above, in the high one of the image.The width of this selected band must be the sufficient to include the markers.In figure 4, she appears selected the column where the scale of this experiment meets.The extracted values of other columns directly will be related to the values contained in the scale.With the region of the selected scale, figure 4, is applied the reduction of [dimensionalidade] for a vector contends the average value of [pixels]. From this vector we can obtain the coordinates that will serve for the identification of the other fragments of [DNA], generated for the enzymatic digestion, as shown in figure 4 (10 to 14).These coordinates are obtained of assisted form, that is, [clicando] in the peaks and extracting the values that will go to compose the scale.
[io] columns 3 to 9 contain the fragments of [DNA] of the virus submitted to enzymes of restriction [Bam] HI, [Dde] I, [Hae] III, [Hinf] I, [Pst] I, [Rsa] I and [Sau] 3AI, respectively.In these columns the same procedures presented for the previous columns will be accomplished, of this form identifying the points of concentration of the pairs of base in each one of the nine columns.
In sequence, the collected values become previously into the procedures presented in the data of the virus, that is, in the values of concentration of pairs of base, to give entered in the genetic algorithm for the had identification.The conversion is made through the following formula:
Pb-- -- --Pb 11 .deg. .deg. g g x [xl] where:
Pb = amount of pairs of base of the point to determine (entire);
x = amount of [pixels] of the point to determine;
Pb 1 = amount of pairs of base of a known point of the scale;
x 1 = amount of [pixels] of Pb 1.
In such a way, the concentrations of pairs of base for each enzyme of restriction are obtained.These values will be stored in a vector to serve of entrance in the GAC for the [genotipagem]. This was made with the 42 more common types of [HPV].
4a Phase - [Genotipagem]: The used algorithm follows the model of [Holland], however with variations and was developed employing the environment of [Delphi] programming that possesses the programming language Object-Paschal.
genetic algorithm uses the entrance variable to make the [genotipagem].
One Will Enter the variable proceeding from the 7 (seven) columns where the restriction enzymes meet.Each column will supply up to 5 values totaling 35 (thirty and five) entrances.The data will have [to] be linearizados to as follows compose the variable of entrance of the GAC: the first column of restriction ([Bam] HI) will supply to 498 data the O the O and the second column ([Dde] to 494 I) will supply the O the 0.
[io] And thus successively, until the column ([Sau] 3AI), in such a way will be completed the data of entrance it virus to be analyzed (498 0000 494 0 the 496 O the O
O 492 0 THE O 205 203 THE O 379 98 THE O 308 194 THE O 0). This procedure must be repeated each sample to be analyzed.
The initial population is generated through the fulfilling of the 100 individuals with selected samples randomly observing the beginnings of the genetic algorithms.
For the composed population of 100 individuals, to each new generation, half of them survives, most suitable, that is, the ones that to possess the lesser value of aptitude.These individuals with its descendants pharaoh leave of the next population.
To another half of the population, that is formed by the descendants, crossing is generated from the use of the genetic operator.For this work, the crossing is accomplished by the addition (or fusion) of two individuals.This addition if of the one each enzyme of restriction enters, producing what it would be the presence of two or more virus in the sample.
After the crossing, the genetic operator mutation is applied in all population.The mutation possesses the 10% probability to occur in each enzyme and consists of the elimination of the lesser value, since he is inferior to 90 Pb.
The elimination of these values diminishes the difference between the sample and the viruses in the table improving the adaptation of this virus in the population.
The objective function that calculates the adaptation of the individual is of lesser distance enters the pairs of base of the sample and the population.How Much lesser it will be the difference, more apt is the individual.With the value of the adaptation measured it can then, to accomplish the elitism where the individuals most apt are placed in the point highest of the population.
The elitism basically consists to accomplish the stage of election in two parts: 1. The elite of X Selects Itself members between the best of initial population [io], which will be incorporated directly the final population, SEM to pass it population auxiliary; 2a. the population auxiliary is selected between N - X
remaining members of the initial population.
In general, the elite has a reduced size, 1 or 2 for [N]=50, and its sampling can be direct, choosing itself simply the best, or for drawing, choosing itself the best between the best of the population.
Thus, a data base with all was created the information of the 42 more common viral types of [HPV], and that they can [be] genotipados by the algorithm, including double infections and until triples.
The present invention could better be understood referring the figures annexes, that it contains diagrams, organization charts, tables, band of scale and images, which conjugated with the descriptive report, aims at to elucidate the peculiarities of the present system of viral [genotipagem].
[Destarte], along with these characteristic is presented a system of viral [genotipagem] to identify and to classify the genotypes of the virus
Human [Papilomavirus] ([HPV]), I contend the requirements of [praticidade], precision, quickness and security to deserve the privilege of pioneer patent.
Example 1
In this example she is presented attainment of the values of pairs of base from the image of the gel of a genotype of virus [HPV] 16. From the image of Figure 6, the values of [pixels], Table 1 are extracted, and after that, converted into pairs of base, presented in Table 2.

Request of entitled Pioneer Patent: ""Catalytic System the Base of Metallic Complexes for Esterificacao de Acidos Graxos or Esterificacao de Oleos and Gorduras de Vegetal or Animal Origem \ Contendo Greasy Acids in Any Ratio""
FIELD TECHNICIAN
The present invention mentions the employment to it of a catalytic system, for esterificacao or esterificacao/transesterificacao of Oils or Fats of Vegetal or Animal Origin, obtained through the coordination of which oxygenated ligantes metallic composites.
More specifically, the present invention deals with the esterificacao of greasy acids, with diverse degrees of insaturacao and size of chain, with mono - alcoois of short chain, such as, among others, methanol or ethanol, and transesterificacao and simultaneous esterificacao of Oils and Fats of Vegetal or Animal Origin I contend triacilglicerideos free greasy acids e in any ratios with mono - alcoois of short chain, such as, among others, methanol or ethanol, using as catalytic complexes of Titanium and Zirconium I contend ligantes oxygenated.
ANTECEDENTS OF THE INVENTION
The technological interest in the ester attainment derived from greasy and mono acids - alcohol, obtained either for the direct esterificacao of greasy acids as mono - short alcohol of chain or for the transesterificacao of mono triacilglicerideos with - short alcohol of chain, Sendo this last preferential route due to bigger availability of this raw material, happens of the possibility of will use them will totally replace partial or the diesel of oil as combustible for engines the internal combustion that use the cycle - diesel, as pointed out for Pinto B. C., L. L. N. Guarieiro, M. J. C. Rezende, N. M. Ribeiro, E. Towers, W. the Lopes, P. Pereira, and of Andrade, J. B. In: J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 16 (2005) 1313. The ester mixture thus obtained, wide known as biodiesel, can be used in engines directly diesel or mixed to the fossil fuel in any ratio, diminishing the emission of pollutants and improving the burning in the engines.In Brazil the use of biodiesel is allowing only in mixtures biodiesel and diesel of oil, Sendo the properties of biodiesel pure and the mixtures, as well as the percentage of mixtures, defined in specific resolutions of the National Agency of the Oil, Gas Natural and biofuels.The transesterificacao reaction is composed of three consecutive and reversible reactions, in which they are formed diacilglicerideos and monoacilglicerideos as intermediate, Sendo formed a mono ester molecule - in each stage.Although the general estequiometria of the equation to require three mols of mono - alcohol for each mol of triacilglicerideo, the reversibility of the reactions makes the necessary an alcohol excess in the half reacional to promote an increase in the income in mono - alcohol.One Knows, still, that in the presence of water also the balance between different esters and its respective greasy and alcoois acids is verified (mono glycerine and/or - alcohol).
The first world-wide patent regarding etanolise of oil of dende was deposited in Belgium (Chavanne, G.; BE 422,877, 1937 (CA 1938, 32, 4313)), which used as catalytic strong bases of Bronsted, as the alcoxidos hydroxide and of alkaline metals.The main limitation of this catalytic system inhabits in the fact of not to be applicable for oils or fats that present high acid value, or high concentration of free greasy acids, due to undesirable reaction of saponificacao, that consumes the catalyser and generates soaps in large amounts, leading the steady emulsion training that hinders the separation and purificacao it biodiesel.However, these traditional basic catalysers wide are used in industry for attainment of biodiesel, therefore, beyond being cheap and little aggressive to the equipment, they present high activities.
The strong acids of Bronsted were proposed initially in the United States (Keim, G. I.; US 2,383-601; 1945), Sendo the main examples the sulfuric acid, phosphoric, cloridrico and organosulfonicos.These catalysers, as described in 1945 document US 2,383-601, are efficient for the production of biodiesel when free greasy acids are present, therefore they do not generate soaps and still they are capable of will catalyze the reaction of esterificacao of the greasy acids for the mono ester production -. In fact, the American patent Keim, G. I.; US 2,383-601; 1945; it uses as strategy for the transesterificacao of Oils and Fats of Vegetal or Animal Origin that contains high text of free acids the agreed use of the two classes of traditional catalysers, becoming, initially, a esterificacao of the greasy acids free presents through catalysis acidify, followed of the transesterificacao of the catalytic triacilglicerideos using basic.However, they are avoided in industry to be very aggressive to the equipment, demanding bigger investments, and also to possess activities up to 4000 inferior times to basic catalysers (B. Freedman, E. H. Pryde and T. L. Mounts, In: J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 6 (1984) 1638).
Thus, it has been looked to develop catalytic systems acids that do not lead to the active soap training and are TAO as the basic ones and that they do not present corrosion problems.Amongst the diverse alternatives proposals, those basing on the use of catalysers that present character I acidify of Lewis has been pointed as highly promising, for the fact of these metallic material catalysers not to provoke corrosion and in such a way to present reactivity for activation of groups acyl, Sendo active for the esterificacao of greasy acids how much for the transesterificacao of esters.For example, recently they were tested complex homogeneous, with character I acidify of Lewis, the type [M +2 (0^0 -) 2], obtained with cations metallic, as Sn +2, Compact Disc +2, +2 Zn and Pb +2, and which oxygenated ligantes double-toothed, as 3-hidroxi-2-methyl-4-pironato (C6H 5 0 3, of now in ahead call only of pirona) (F. R. Abreu, D. G. Lima, E. H. Hamu, S. Einloft, J. C. Rubim and P. the Z. Suarez, In: J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 80 (2003) 601; e F. R. Abreu, D. G. Lima, E. H. Hamu, C. Wolf and P. the Z. Suarez, In: J. MoI. you Scoop Up. : Chem. 209 (2004) 29) e carboxilatos (M. Di Serio, R. Tesser, M. Dimiccoli, F. Cammarota, M. Nastasi and E. Santacesaria, In: J. Mol. you Scoop Up. : Chem. 239 (2005) 111). In metanolise of the soy oil it was verified that the activity of these catalysers is associated with its acidity, Sendo the system most active Sn (C 6 H 5 0 3) 2 (H 2) 2, with the advantage of obtaining an easy separation of biodiesel and of the glycerine in the end of the reaction.It Must be pointed out that, for system with exactly low activity as Compact Disc (acetate) 2, it was possible to optimize the reacionais conditions to obtain high conversions.This class of catalysers also was tested in alcoolise of different vegetal and alcoois oils and in the esterificacao of greasy acids, occurring a reduction in the activity of Sn (C6H503) 2 (H20) 2 with the increase in carbonic the chain and degree of ramification of the employed alcohol and with the degree of saturation and length of the chain of the greasy acids that compose the vegetal oil.However, the high cost and toxicidade of these homogeneous catalysers, united to the difficulty of its complete withdrawal of biodiesel, disabling its recovery and its I reuse, hinder its industrial use as catalytic for the reaction of transesterificacao of vegetal oils.
Composites of titanium and zirconium with raised acidity of Lewis, above all the alcoxidos ones, also called ortoesteres, are known as catalytic efficient in reactions of esterificacao and transesterificacao.To See, for example, American patent US 2,822,348; 1958. However, these systems are sufficiently sensitive to the humidity and impurities of the half reacional, also unstable in the presence of free greasy acids, what they limit its use for the esterificacao.In the American patent Hoffmann.; US 6,541,411; 2003, the authors describe the preparation and the use of catalysers obtained of the reaction of one or more alcoxidos or alcoxidos condensed of titanium or zirconium with one or more polialcoois.According To the authors, such strategy revealed efficient in the attainment of more steady catalysers to the reacionais conditions of esterificacao or transesterificacao.
It Was Revealed, therefore, that literature presents a variety of active catalytic systems for the attainment of biodiesel for esterificacao of greasy acids or transesterificacao or alcoolise of Oils and Fats, either using acids or bases of Bronsted or acids of Lewis, including composites of Titanium and Zirconium, which are presented sufficiently active but sensitive to the present impurities in raw materials, what it limits the use of the same.
present invention consists of the use of ligantes which oxygenated double-toothed for the stabilization of metallic complexes of Titanium and Zirconium, with high acidity of Lewis, for the esterificacao of greasy acids or transesterificacao of oils and fats, as described for Y. C. Brito, V. M. Mello, C. C. S. Macedo, M. R. Meneghetti, P. the Z. Suarez and S. M. P. Meneghetti, in: Applied Cat. :
General. 351:1 (2008) 24.

The Oils and Fats of Vegetal or Animal Origin as referred to in the present report and claims typically understand composite mixtures diverse, such as free, triacilglicerideos, diacilglicerideos, monoacilglicerideos and fosfolipidios acids greasy.The greasy acids contain different degrees of insaturacao, being able to vary of to 5 double connections, and size of chain, I contend of 4 to 30 carbon atoms, and can be free or agreed with glycerine or I acidify it fosfoglicerico.
The mono ones - alcoois used for the esterificacao of greasy acids or transesterificacao of gliceridicos composites they are alcoois of short chain, I contend of a 1 to 8 atoms of carbon and in the maximum group hidroxila.Thus, the agents of esterificacao or referred to transesterificacao or alcoolise in this report include, among others, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, ISO-propanol, nbutanol, terc-butanol, n-pentanol, n-octanol and cycle-hexanol.For the commercial availability, the methanol and the ethanol are the preferred agents.
The useful catalytic used metal composites of transition as precursory in the present invention understand inorganic composites of cations metallic tetravalentes, such as 4 TiX or ZrX 4, being able X to be any halogenio, and Ti (4 OR) or Zr (OR) 4, being able R to be a linear group organic alquil, ramified, cyclical, saturated, insaturado or aromatical.
Although several amongst composites above have BoA activity as catalytic for the esterificacao of greasy acids or esterificacao/transesterificacao of Oils and Fats I contend free greasy acids in any ratio, the petitioners had chosen the systems formed for the complexes You (0-n-butil) x (3-hidroxi-2-methyl-4-pironato) 4. x and Zr (0-n-butil) x (3 - hidroxi-2-methyl-4-pironato) 4. x, with x varying between and the 4.
The present invention understands, therefore, the process of esterificacao of greasy acids or esterificacao/transesterificacao of Oils and Fats I contend free greasy acids in any ratios using as precursory catalytic the complexes chosen for the petitioners: You (0-n-butil) x (3-hidroxi-2- methyl-4-pironato) 4 x and Zr (0-n-butil) x (3-hidroxi-2-methyl-4-pironato) 4 x, with x varying between 0 and 4.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
In the laboratory, the reactions of esterificacao of greasy acids and esterificacao/transesterificacao of oils or fats I contend free greasy acids were lead in steel reactors inox of 100 mL and with magnetic agitation.A typical experiment involved the ratio of 10 g of greasy acids or oil or fat I contend free greasy acids, 1,5 methanol g and catalyser in the desired amount.Diverse times of reaction were studied, amounts of catalyser and also the temperature was varied.
The reacionais products were analyzed by titration acidify/base, using KOH as method AOCS Cd3d63, and additionally for liquid chromatography of high efficiency, using a chromatograph type CTO-20A
of the Shimadzu with detector UV-VIS in X, = 205 nm, equipped with column Shim- PacK VP-ODS (C-18, 250 mm, 4,6 mm of internal diameter).
To follow the present invention will be illustrated by the Examples below, that they do not have to be considered limitative of the same.
EXAMPLES 1
The Examples of 1 to 10, shown in Table 1, demonstrate that the reaction of esterificacao of greasy acids employing methanol can be accomplished using diverse transition metal composites (You and Zr), contend the ligante which oxygenated double-toothed in diverse ratios.The Example 1 sample that in the three studied temperatures occurs the same reaction in the absence of metallic catalyser, what it can be explained due to autocatalise once I acidify it greasy possesses acidity of sufficiently strong Bronsted. For all the used catalytic systems were verified a significant increase in the activity with the increase of the temperature of the reaction.Table 1 also demonstrates that, in conditions similar, but not optimized, the better activities was obtained for the complexes of Zirconium (Examples of 07 to 10), that they present for the three temperatures obtained well superior reacionais incomes to SEM catalytic or for the Titanium catalysers.Comparing the Examples of 01 with 03, one perceives that using the complexes of Zirconium and SEM Titanium the double-toothed ligante does not observe catalytic activity of the metallic complex suplemental to that one observed in the autocatalisada reaction, once the obtained incomes are comparable.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention says respect to a process of production of biodiesel for transesterificacao, where communis seeds of Ricinus mamona daily pay - processed they are fish steaks in contact with an alcohol, specific pH, to produce biodiesel, SEM the necessity of catalyser addition, once pro pria lipase acidifies present in the seed of mamona acts as only catalyser, SEM extraction necessity and purificacao of the enzyme.
Biodiesel is a fuel liquid synthetic, originating of materiasprimas renewable and consisting by alquilicos monoester mixture of greasy acids of long chains, vegetal oil derivatives animal and fats.It Has much time already is employed as combustible, pure or in mixture.It Possesses you are - pecificacao of international reference defined it American Society will be Testing Materiais (ASTM) known by designation PS 121-99.
Some patents (US 5,578,090; 6,017,369 US and US 6,129,773) describes and proves the viability technique of the motor use of biodiesel as combustible to propagate or stationary, pure or in mixture with the diesel oil of oil.
The production of biodiesel of - for a reaction of transesterificacao between molecules of triacilgricerideos and the alcoois, in the presence of a catalyser.The used raw material is proceeding from vegetal or animal oils and fats, and a short alcohol of chain.Catalysis Can be employed acidifies, alkaline, heterogeneous or for enzymes.
Mamona has been considered as a oleaginosa with potential for production of biodiesel due to its raised oil text.
STATE OF THE TECHNIQUE
Diverse patents (US 4,695,411; US 4,364,743; US 5,525,126; US
6,017,369 and US 6,129,773) they describe processes of production of biodiesel, characterizing the state of the technique of this mentioned process as, that is, a transesterificacao of the triglicerideos of vegetal oils or animal fats, with primary inferior alcoois, catalyzed for one I acidify or a base.After the reaction follows the refinement of the products and by-products of the reaction, after a physical separation of the liquid phases in the reactor after the distillation of the alcohol excess.
Some interesting variations inside of the state of the technique can also be noticed.One of them is the elimination of the stage of extraction of the oil of the vegetal seeds.Another variation is the catalysis of the reaction of transesterificacao for specific enzymes.A significant setback for the productive chain of biodiesel is the high cost of the oleaginosa raw material.The vegetal oil extraction and purificacao put up the end item.To skirt the problem, in the decade of eighty was conceived the transesterificacao process in situ (Harrington and Of Arcy-Evans, 1985), where the seeds of oleaginosas are macerated for release of its oil, and the alcohol and the catalyser are added to the macerated seeds so that the reaction occurs.Biodiesel produced is later separate of the reagents and the other products.This exactly process was researched later by diverse authors, between which Kildiran, Ozgul-Yucel and Turkay (1996), Siler- Marinkovic and Tomasevic (1998) and Haas and collaborators (2004).The Brazilian patent PI 0105888-6 describes a process for production of biodiesel using seeds of mamona, SEM the necessity of extraction of the oil, using the technique of in situ described transesterificacao above.The same process was also deposited in the USPTO, under number US 7,112,229. They Exist beyond these, other deposits also related the processes of you settle - terificacao (FR2919303-A1 in situ; W02009013349 - A1).
The enzymatic catalysis of the transesterificacao reaction has the advantage to produce an effluent with lesser complexity of treatment, not to be necessary the correction of pH. Moreover, the reaction if of the one in softer way and not to require the handling of dangerous reagents.Enzymes of vegetal or microbian origin Can be used.However, the involved cost in the production and enzyme purificacao are capable economically to make impracticable its use in the production of biodiesel.The enzyme class used in transesterificacao reactions is of lipases.
Mamona possesses one lipase that he is active same in the seed in training of dormencia.It Has its optimum pH in the band between 4 and 5.This enzyme is capable to catalyze quickly the hydrolysis reaction (lipolise) of the oil of mamona producing greasy acids and glycerol (Ory, St. Angelo and Altschul, 1960). This activity was verified, as much with the extracted enzyme and purificada, how much in HO- process lise in situ (Rao, Paulose and Lakshminarayana, 1990), where the enzyme is not extracted of priorly.
The use of the lipolitica activity of lipase of mamona SEM extraction and purifica- dog soundings is present in the deposit PI 0603824-7 A2, that describes a process for production of biodiesel in two stages, where lipase of mamona not purificada and not extracted, present in the seed of mamona macerated, can be employed will catalyze the production of greasy acids through hydrolysis of lipidic material.After this stage, is accomplished the esterificacao of these carboxilicos acids with alcoois of short chain having used catalytic solids to the base of places acids.That is, still the addition of a catalyser, not enzymatic is necessary, so that biodiesel is produced.
Lipase of mamona, beyond hydrolysis of lipidic material, also is capable to catalyze the reaction of esterificacao of greasy acids to the glycerol, fact verified for Tuter (1998), after extraction of the enzyme.Lipase of mamona has the potential of being used to catalyze all the stages of the production of biodiesel, namely, the hydrolysis of lipidic material and the esterificacao of the carboxilicos acids with alcoois of short chain.However, such development never was mentioned previously in scientific patents or works.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention says respect to a process of production of biodiesel for transesterificacao, where seeds of mamona daily pay - processed they are fish steaks in contact with an alcohol, specific pH, to produce biodiesel, SEM the necessity of catalyser addition, once proper lipase acidifies present in the seed of mamona acts as only catalyser, SEM necessity of extra dog and purificacao of the enzyme.
The invention foresees the possibility of addition of other oils and fats to the reaction, beyond that one contained in the seeds of mamona.These oils also suffer transesterificacao saw lipase of mamona.Preferentially, they are used material lipidic residual with raised acidity text, that does not harm the reaction.This innovative process reduces the cost of biodiesel, diminishes the related environmental impacts to the production of this biofuel and includes mamona, a culture of social interest indispensably, in the vile scene of biocombusti-.
The present invention has potential to simplify the production of biodiesel and to return it more viable economically and also under the point of view partner - environmental, therefore:
I. Diminishes the cost of the raw material, to it will dismiss to the stage of extraction and vegetal oil purificacao to it;
II. Another one does not need catalyser addition that not that one already naturally present in the seed of mamona (enzyme);
III. The generated watery residues can be dealt with simpler way of what those generated in the conventional process, since they are not alkaline;
IV. The technology of anaerobic biological treatment for the effluent of the process Can be employed, also with the production of biogas and exploitation in the proper process;
V. Includes, in indispensable and definitive way, mamona in the scene it biodiesel, a culture of ample social interest and sometimes discredited and discouraged point of view economic technician to it and for its use in the productive chain biodiesel them;
VI. The process is simple, and in the case of the ethanol use, it does not require handling of dangerous reagents, thus showing potential to be used in technological conditions of low scales, also in the rural areas and cooperatives;
VII. The process can use as lipidic raw material, together with the oil of mamona, not nourishing materials of low aggregate value and, as for example, oils with raised acidity text, residual oils of fritter and residues with raised amount of oils and fats.
DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
A present process destines altogether to produce it biodiesel through the transesterificacao of the present triglicerideos in the seed of mamona, alone or with another lipidic material, an alcohol of short chain, using as catalytic lipase of mamona present in the seed, SEM the extraction necessity and purificacao of the oil of mamona nor of the enzyme.
The invention foresees the indispensable use of the seed of mamona, that it can be cultivated in poor ground, being able to be joined with the beans or cassava culture, and to be cultivated in small SEM properties the use of intensive technology.
In accordance with the process, (a) the seeds are daily pay - processed in order to display its oil and its lipolitica enzyme.This stage of daily pay - processing understands maceration, but it does not have to understand baking, therefore this would desnaturaria the enzyme.The daily pay - processing can or not understand hidratacao. (b) The seeds of mamona daily pay - processed they are fish steaks in a reactor endowed with agitation, to the ambient temperature, alone or together with another lipidic material, that can be another vegetal oil that not it of mamona, animal fat, residual oil of fritter or lipidic water material recouped residua- you laugh.The used oils can have a high text of acidity, what it does not harm the reaction.Or still, it can be used as source of lipidic material seeds or macerated vegetal fruits, in order to display its triglicerideos. (c) After the setting of the lipidic material is added to a system drain plug for control of pH in the band between 4,0 and 5,0. The system drain plug is preferentially the acetate.The pH control can also be accomplished only through adi - dog of one I acidify organic weak, preferentially I acidify ascetic diluted, with concentration between 1 and 0,01 N. (d) the content of the reactor, already under agitation, then it is placed in contact with an alcohol, for example, methanol or ethanol, preferentially ethanol, in ratio of 0,25 to 4 parts of lipidic material for 1 alcohol part.In order to hinder the denaturalization of the enzyme for the alcohol, the same can be added to the few to the reactor.
(e) The transesterificacao reaction is catalyzed by lipase acidifies present in the seed of mamona.It Will Be Able to occur, before the addition of alcohol to the reactor, lipolise of a fraction of the present triglicerideos in the seed of mamona.The reaction will preferentially process in a temperature between 20 .deg. and .deg. C, for a period of 30 to 180 minutes.The reaction could be accomplished in batelada, SEM the withdrawal of no material until its ending, or with the selective withdrawal of products or by-products of the reaction until its ending.Alternatively, it could be accomplished in a continuous process, where constantly products and by-products of the reaction are removed, Sendo added more raw material proportionally to the withdrawal of materials. (f) After the ending of the reaction, the products, by-products, residues and reagents is separate for common physical methods.First she is accomplished filtration of the reacional mass, to the ambient temperature or after prior heating the temperature between 35 .deg. and 45 .deg.

""[ELETROCOAGULADOR] FOR RESIDUARY WATER TREATMENT""
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention mentions a [eletrocoagulador] reactor to it hardwired to a [floculador] and followed of a system of filtration for treatment in continuous flow of industrial effluents, in particular, of the produced water, capable to deal with great volumes water during long periods, SEM interruption of the process.
The removal of present impurities in industrial or domestic effluents requires treatment methods that directly are related with the type of generated contaminant.Oils, polishes, weighed, [fenois] metals, ammonia, cyanides, [sulfetos], among others, are present contaminants in these effluents, whose concentrations vary with the place of the extraction and that they need to be eliminated before the discarding in the environment.
The methods [floculantes] coagulants/have been the most applied to remove solids in suspension.The clotted material can be removed through sedimentation or by filtration, to depend on the operational conditions.
The main inorganic coagulants are leave them aluminum and iron, in particular the aluminum sulfate and the ferric chloride.The mechanism of performance of these you leave can be divided in three stages: (1) overtaking of the limit of solubility of the aluminum or iron hydroxide; (2) [adsorcao] of the respective hydroxide on the colloidal surfaces; (3) neutralization of the superficial load, considering that in typical conditions of the process, the metallic hydroxide is positively loaded and the colloidal particles are negatively loaded.
The limitations of the coagulation are: the requirement of bigger amount of [ions] added coagulants mechanically, more mud is formed and the unit of treatment necessary to be ampler than a unit with electrochemical generation, Sendo that this becomes inadequate for the installation where the available space sufficiently is limited.Moreover, the mechanical addition of the coagulant demands greater controls and effort to obtain the homogenization of the mixture.
STATE OF THE TECHNIQUE
The [Eletrocoagulacao] is a procedure that has if shown sufficiently efficient in the treatment of effluents it is the [eletrocoagulacao], that consists basically of the accomplishment of a electrolysis with sacrifice anodes.Aluminum and iron are material well appropriate to suffer oxidation in this process due to the low potential applied for its oxidation, to be optimum agents coagulants and to be easily recouped and recycled in the end of the process.
The studies made with [eletrocoaguladores], though its good results, demonstrate only the efficiency of the [eletrocoagulacao] in the removal of specific contaminants, analysed separately.
Moreover, the great majority of the studies is made in [batelada] and the few that are in continuous flow do not advance until a point that in the practice is fundamental, that it is the separation of formed flakes of the SEM effluent them to undo and SEM to harm the good income of the flocculation obtained after the [eletrocoagulacao].
The existing [eletrocoaguladores] already, that they allow the treatment in continuous flow do not dispose of mechanism and format appropriate for removal of flakes in the continuity of the process and SEM to destroy such flakes.Moreover, they do not present resulted that they guarantee its functioning and the adequacy of its format for the treatment of the produced water, since this water possesses a great diversity of contaminants.
Some found previous technologies in the base of patents apply the [eletrocoagulacao], however they do not use the technologies presented in present the proposal.The [PI]0704744-4 A2 defers from the present invention will mention a [Eletroflotador] and a [eletrocoagulador] to it for treatment of effluents in continuous flow using the same module.Another difference is the alternating position of the [lamelas].
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention proposes a [eletrocoagulador] reactor hardwired to a [floculador] and followed of a system of filtration for treatment in continuous flow of industrial effluents, in particular, of the produced water, capable to deal with great volumes water during long periods, SEM interruption of the process.
Differently of the present solutions in the state of the technique, the present invention brings the following advantages:
(i) the position of the electrodes that, after the deterioration, can easily be substituted, even though SEM necessity of interruption of the treatment process;
(II) the positions of the [lamelas] in the [floculador] that provide one better separation of the majority of the SEM flakes to destroy them (remembering that such destruction would liberate the contaminants in return the water);
(III) the woolen use (synthetic or natural) as first layer in the box of filtration, what it provides the separation of the SEM flakes to block the ticket of the treated liquid, Sendo also the wool of easy substitution during the process, when this will be saturated.
(IV) the [eletrocoagulacao], that occurs in (a), are accomplished in different container of the flocculation.This methodology guarantee the preservation of formed flakes, therefore the [eletrocoagulador] functions with vigorous agitation while the [floculador] (b) allows to greater rest of the effluent during the flow.

The Figure (d) shows the complete set of the modules of the [eletrocoagulador].
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The present invention refers to if to a [eletrocoagulador] reactor that consists of three main parts: the [eletrocoagulador] properly said, a [floculador] and a box of filtration.
The dimensions of these three parts must adjust the treatment necessity and to the available space, having to keep a ratio enters the volume of the [coagulador] for the optimum volume of the [floculador] of 1:20 (one for twenty) the 1:25 (one for twenty and five).The box of filtration must at least have the double of the volume of the [floculador].
The initial [pH] of the effluent must preferably be between 8 and 10, where the effluent leaves the reactor with next [pH] to the neutral one.The applied chain density (j) must be proportional the outflow of the effluent (q) and inversely proportional the total area of the anodes (a) and can be calculated for the following relation:
j = 0,715 x - Q
[Obs].: This ratio was established [considerando] the necessity to generate 0,24 for the moment g of [cation] aluminum for liter of effluent and of treatment.
With these measured for the reactor, the time of residence of the effluent in the [eletrocoagulador] ([tRC]) and the time of residence in the [floculador] ([tRF]) they can be, respectively, determined for:
[Vr] TAC = Q
[VF]
[tRF] = -
Where [Vc] are the volume of the [Eletrocoagulador] and [VF] is the volume of the [Floculador]. Detailing of the [Eletrocoaqulador]
The effluent must enter in the [Eletrocoagulador] figures (a) for the superior entrance, in (1), promoting a descending flow, being able to be used a shower or bolts to promote the entrance of form distributed for all reactor, so that the flow gives itself uniformly enters all the aluminum plates.A ticket register (2) is used to control the outflow of the effluent.
[Considerando] a [eletrocoagulador] with dimensions width (l) x length (c) x height (h), the aluminum plates (anodes and cathodes) must have the same height (h) of the reactor, however they are placed leaving 10% of its height (0,1H) between these and I smelt it of the reactor (therefore, [sobrando] 0,1H in the superior part).This surplus has the intention to facilitate the substitution of the SEM electrodes to interrupt the process.The dimensions of the reactor are adaptable the necessities of the usufructuary.
Detailing of the [Floculador]
The volume of the [floculador] must be of twenty times at least bigger that of the [eletrocoagulador]. Therefore, its dimensions must be proportional 2L x 10C
x 1,2H.
The effluent enters in the [floculador] figure (b) through an entrance located in (3) that it must be located to a height around 0,2H and follows a flow that passes under the three first [lamelas] (4, 5 and 6), later goes up and passes over the three next ones (7, 8 and 9), after that it goes down and it passes under others three [lamelas] (10, 11 and 12).The alternating combination of three [lamelas] on and three under can be extended for four or more than agreement with the necessity, as well as the group number of [lamelas] it can increase to raise the efficiency of the [floculador] or case is desired to work with bigger outflows.The [lamelas] can be in the vertical position or with soft inclinations, of 5 to 10 .deg., I distributed of uniformly along the length of the [floculador]. In the distance between them it must be preferably of 15 to 25% of its height (h).In the distance between the superior [lamelas] and I smelt it of the [floculador] must preferably be around 0,2H (***0,05H). The [lamelas] settled in I smelt it (inferior) must have a height H, compatible with the height of the exit of the [floculador] (exactly level), that is, the exit of the [floculador] must be to a height H in respect to base.
This position of the [lamelas] considerably increases the retention of flakes in the [floculador], what it also means a profit in the income of the removal of the contaminants, therefore with the [lamelas] simply alternated one by one, the flakes, that are very light and fragile, follow the flow together with the water and, in the filtration process, is in part destroyed, liberating contaminants in return for the water.With the placed [lamelas] as proposed (3 in 3, 4 in 4 or more) most of flakes it sediments or ""it floats"" enters the [lamelas] for where it does not have
flow, and this also favours the bigger and more steady flake training.Detailing of the box of filtration
Through the pipe (13), with changeable diameter (0,5"" to 2"" in accordance with the dimension of the reactor) the effluent passes of the [floculador] figure (b) for the box of filters dog figures (c).As the effluent leaves the [floculador] still contends a significant amount of formed flakes, the exit of the pipe (13) must be well next (if possible, leaned) of the first filter element that is the wool.This box of filters
dog must be strickles and wide, being able its dimensions to stay around 8L x 10C x 0,6H. In the first compartment of the box (14) they stay ready up the layers of the filter elements in the following order of low: road metal zero, granulated sand e, superficially, the wool (natural or synthetic).The road metal layers, of woolen sand and must have around 0,1 H of thickness each.The compartment
(14) he stays separate of the exit of the box for a [lamela] (15), Sendo that enters this [lamela] and I smelt it of the box must have a space of 0,1H approximately.In the section of the box between the [lamela] and the exit (16) it must have the filter elements road metal and sand, not Sendo necessary the wool.
The woolen use (natural or artificial), preferably glass wool in the box of filtration, as first layer of filtration is capable holds back flakes causing little or no destruction of these and preserving BoA condition of the other filter elements (sand and road metals).Moreover, the wool takes longer well ""to be saturated"" with the gel formed for aluminum flakes and, when this occurs, can easily be removed and substituted, Sendo this more favourable item not the interruption of the treatment process.SEM the use of the wool the sand quickly stays waterproofed for the aluminum gel and the substitution of the sand is not simple TAO how much of the wool.

Introduction the present invention mentions the application to it of palladium complexes contends ligantes benzodiazepinicos, its incorporation in pharmaceutical formulations, as well as its use in the treatment of convulsions.More specifically, the present invention deals with the employment of organometalicos composites of palladium (II) contends ligantes with proven anticonvulsivante action fenilbenzodiazepinicos composite derivatives that acquire a bigger action due to complexacao with the palladium.
State of the technique the benzodiazepinicos are capable to stimulate in the brain mechanisms that normally balance states of tension and anxiety.In this direction, some patents, such as PI0619057-0, PI0617204-0, PI0615922-2, PI0614792-5, PI0214301-1, PI0211124-1, use of benzodiazepinicos and its derivatives for the treatment of a gamma of riots, amongst them Alzheimer, schizophrenia, and too much riots, mainly involving the Central Nervous System.
In respect to the made up of the present study, encore [2- {(7-I chlorinate 1 - metill-2-oxo-2,3- dihidro-1H-benzodiazepin-5-il) phenyl-k 2 - C, N} - .micro. 2 - acetaiopaladio (11)] represented of now in ahead for [DIAZPdOAc] 2, no document of patent was found for its use, as well as for its attainment, becoming thus important the claim of the use of this composition with the presented properties to follow.
Antecedents of the invention In general, medication are formed organic composites, basically, of elements C, H, N, and the S; however, it currently has a significant number of medication that has in its composition metallic elements, Sendo then called metalofarmacos.As classic examples, the platinum complexes derived from the cisplatina are cited, that widely are employed in the quimioterapico treatment of cancerigenas cells and composites; antimony complexes, known as antimonial, for the treatment of the leishmaniasis; gold e, for the treatment of arthritis.Inside of this context, it is that this I invent is inserted, objectifying the attainment of medication more powerful and or toxic meno from the association of medication with metals (metalofarmacos).This strategy has as objective to modify the levels of absorption, biodistribuicao and biotransformacao (HAMBLEY, 2007) of these composites front to traditional substances I contend these farmacoforicos groups (VIaNJEVAC et al., 2002).
It Has stories of the training of complexes derived from 1,4 - and 1,5-benzodiazepinicos with diverse metals: palladium (II) (AVERSE et al., 1990); platinum (II) (AVERSE et al., 1991); I tin (IV) (SURESH et al., 2008); iron (II); e cobalt (II) (ZHANG et al., 2007); et covers (II) (FORIZS al., 1997; FORIZS et al., 1999; VIaNJEVAC et al., 2001);

et al., 2002; SPENCER et al., 2008; SPENCER et al., 2009); e platinum (II) (AVERSE et al., 1991). These benzodiazepinicos fragments can be presented coordinate to mono the metallic center as ligantes, bi- or tridentados, whose connection metal-ligante occurs through elements as nitrogen, oxygen and or carbon.Although this relative number of found benzodiazepinicos complexes already, its respective evaluations as anticonvulsivantes agents, was not informed.In terms of evaluation of the biological activity of these complexes, they were found, until the present moment, two stories.One of these in vitro mentions studies to it of the citostatica and antiviral activity of complexes of PDD (II), Zn (II) and Cu (II) derivatives of 1,4 - benzodiazepinicos ones; a total of six complexes (two complexes of each metal) was analyzed and the results had disclosed that none of the complexes presents citostatica activity in therapeutically significant concentrations and all the complexes present none or only marginal antiviral activity (VIaNJEVAC et al., 2002). The other document in vitro presents studies of citotoxicidade against a cellular ancestry of human cancer and the inhibiting activity on the catepsina B (involved enzyme in events related to the cancer) bovine, where derivatives of 1,4-benzodiazepinicos were analyzed seven complexes of PDD (II). The results had shown that three complexes present BoA cytotoxic activity (Sendo two of these, excellent inhibiters of catepsina B; e one of these, inhibiting moderate), three presents moderate cytotoxic activity (two of these had also presented moderate inhibiting activity on catepsina B and one of these was presented as a weak inhibiter), and one was essentially inactive with regard to the citotoxicidade (and presented weak inhibiting activity on the catepsina B) (SPENCER et al., 2009). From then on, the development of benzodiazepinicos complexes of palladium was proposed, some of these unknown ones, to evaluate the activity of the same with anticonvulsivantes agents.Detailed Description of the invention the below described modalities better objectify to explain the ways known for the practice of the invention and to allow that the technician in the area uses the invention in such, or other modalities and with some necessary modifications for the specific applications or uses of the present invention.It Is the intention that the present invention includes all the modifications and variations of the same, inside of the described target in the report and in the claims you annex.The necessity to propose and to develop new anticonvulsivantes medications is, without a doubt, fundamental.The current medications have its use frequently limited due to strong collateral effects that are observed (RANG et al., 2004) e, moreover, do not have an effective prophylaxis for the treatment of the epileptic convulsions (MCNAMARA, 2005). Of this form this invention has as proposal the use of metalofarmacos the palladium base I contend ligantes fenilbenzodiazepinicos.The choice of the palladium horn metal 'for the generation of metalofarmacos potentials derivatives of benzodiazepinicos, more specifically, 5-feni1-1,4-benzodiazepinicos, is associated with the reactivity that this metal presents of will generate a organometalico complex with one strong connection metal - carbon with the substitute fenila in the position orto of the benzodiazepinico group, what a ring would take the training, one paladaciclo, normally of five members of sufficiently steady structure (OMAE, 2004).
Synthesis of the metalado benzodiazepinico [DIAZPdOAcJ 2 Prepared an acetate solution of palladium (II) (0,200 g; 0,891 mmol) in I acidify ascetic (15 mL) and after that, g was added diazepam (0,285; 1,00 mmol).
reaction proceeded under agitation and reflux for 1 hour.After this time, filtered the obtained material which was dry the vacuum to remove all acidifies it ascetic.After that, to the solid material, chloroform in amount enough was added to solubilizar the same and was added hexane until complete precipitation of the desired composition Sendo dried to the vacuum, obtaining itself thus a solid orange.Income: 84%.

The characterization of all the synthetized complexes was accomplished by nuclear magnetic resonance of 'H and 13 C and spectrometry in the infra-red ray.Moreover, [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 had its structure also confirmed by means of spectrometry of masses; complex e monomerico DIAZPdOAcPPh 3 had its training also evidenced for 31 RMN of P.
Spectrometry of Magnetic Resonance Nuclear of 1 H (RMN of 1 11) the specter of RMN of 1 H of [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 proves the high fluxionalidade that this complex presents and to the interconversao between isomers cisoide and transoide in solution, what it results in specters with great number of signals widened superranks and or.It Is possible to attribute to the referring signals to the hidrogenios of on group metila to nitrogen 1 of the benzodiazepinico ring, and in the case of [DIAZPdOAc] the 2, also it was possible to attribute to the referring simpletos signals to the hidrogenios of metila Da Ponte acetate (6 = 2,24 ppm); moreover, it was possible to observe the referring typical signals to the aromatical hidrogenios of diazepam it with chemical displacements between 8,4 and 6,4 ppm.Typically the signals of the metilenicos hidrogenios of the diazepinico ring are seen as two signals (to be diastereotopicos) for the transoide isomer; on the other hand, for the cisoide isomer four signals are observed, 'in the case of [DIAZPdOAc] the 2, this occur therefore these hidrogenios are in distinct magnetic environments.The integration between the majority and minority signals was employed for the observation of the ratio enters two isomers of the complexes, with this, was verified that [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 approximately have a reason of 1:1 between isomers transoide: cisoide.
Better to attribute the signals of the aromatical hidrogenios of diazepam it, is added piridina deuterada to dimero; of this form, through the RMN specters
of 1 H of monomers generated in solution, derived from [DIAZPdOAc] the 2, it was possible to observe all the signals of the hidrogenios of, diazepam with exception of a proton, what it indicates the occurrence of the organometalica connection between the palladium and they diazepam it, beyond the signal of hydrogen of metila of the group acetate (6 = 2,28 ppm), in the case of derived monomer & [DIAZPdOAc] 2; deducing itself, thus, the training of the dimericos paladaciclos.
In the specter of the DIAZPdC1Py beyond the referring signals to the hidrogenios of they diazepam it desprotonado, also is possible to observe the addition of three typical signals of aromatical hidrogenios with chemical displacements between 9,0 and 7,4 ppm, that is the referring signals to the hidrogenios of the piridina (dupleto with 6 = 8,93 referring ppm to the hidrogenios in orto, tripleto with 8 = 7,90 referring ppm to hydrogen in for, and tripleto 6 = 7,49 referring ppm to the hidrogenios in goal, in the ratio of 2:1: 2); the multiplicity and the values of the integrals of all these signals, altogether, confirm the training of this monomer.
The specters of RMN of 'H of paladaciclo monomerico DIAZPdOAcPPh 3 desprotonado shows the referring signals to diazepam it, beyond typical signals of aromatical hidrogenios with chemical displacements between 7,9 and 7,3 ppm, that is referring to the hidrogenios of the trifenilfosfina; e, in the case of DIAZPdOAcPPh 3, also observes the relative signal simpleto to the hidrogenios of metila of the group acetate (6 = 1,44 ppm); such data confirm the attainment of these monomers.Moreover, it is possible to observe the coupling of the diastereotopicos metilenicos hidrogenios of it also diazepam with the match of the trifenilfosfina and the coupling of hydrogen ortho to connection C - PDD with the match.
Nuclear Spectrometry of Magnetic Resonance of 13 C (RMN of 13 C) Through the analysis for 13 RMN of C of [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 is possible to identify the typical signals of carbonila (8 between 170 and 167 ppm) of it diazepam and the group acetate as ligante, it is possible to observe the signal of carbon of metila (6 between 25 and 23 ppm) and of quaternary carbon (6 between 182 and 179 ppm) of this group.Moreover, when the specters of 13 are compared RMN of C of the complexes with the one of the ligante free, verificase the displacement from the signals of the C=N and one from carbon atoms ortho of the substitute 5-fenila for raised values of frequency well more (respectively, 6 of 169 ppm for values between 181 and 177 ppm, and of 7 - - -; 130 ppm for values between 160 and 153 ppm), indicating the ciclopaladacao.
The specter of the complexes DIAZPdOAcPPh 3 shows referring signals to the trifenilfosfina, of more specific form is possible to observe: two very referring intense signals to tertiary carbons in ortho (6 135 ppm) and in goal (6 z - -; 128 ppm), both as dupletos due to the coupling with the match atom; a referring signal dupleto to quaternary carbons (6 r= -: 139 ppm) that they are connected to the match atom; e a signal dupleto of referring high intensity to the tertiary carbons that meet in for (6 131 ppm), that lightly they are connected to the match atom.
Nuclear Spectrometry of Magnetic Resonance of 31 P (31 RMN of P) Through the analysis for 31 RMN of P of the DIAZPdOAcPPh3 was possible to identify in both the specters the presence of match signals that evidence the presence of the trifenilfosfina ligante.In the case of the specter of [DIAZPd0Ac] the 2 it was possible to identify two signals, a referring majority signal to the complex that presents a relation trans between connections N - Pd and Pd - P; e a referring minority signal to the complex that previously presents a relation cis between the which cited connections.Spectrometry in Average Infra-red Ray (IV) the infra-red ray specters of the dimeros and monomers were compared with the one of the ligante free, having observed themselves thus all the main characteristic bands of diazepam it as, for example, the band in -1700 cm -1 referring carbonila and the imina of the diazepinico ring.Moreover, it was possible to observe the characteristic bands of the group acetate in the specter of [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 and DIAZPdOAcPPh 3. These results together with the change observed in the coloration of the dimeros and monomers when compared with the ligante they give indications of the training of the complexes.
Pharmacological Studies For accomplishment of the pharmacological tests were used mice (Mus musculus), of the ancestry Swiss, males, Albino, weighing enter 25 - 33 grams originating the Central Bioterio of the University, selected and lodged in polypropylene river steamers, I contend five animals each, kept under controlled conditions of 22 temperature of 1 .deg.C and/clearly dark cycle of 12 hours (clear phase: 06:00 - 18:00 hours), having free access the feeding (type pellets of ration) and water.Before the accomplishment of any experimental protocol, the animals were placed in the work environment (laboratory), for at least thirty minutes of antecedence to the execution of the experiment, aiming at to the adaptation to the new environment and to avoid possible behavioral modifications of the animals.
All the experimental protocols, 'proposed respect the ethical criteria of animal experimentation praised by the Brazilian Society of Sciences in Animals of Laboratory (SBCAL) and the Council International will be Laboratoly Animal Science (ICLAS). Moreover, the present study it was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Animal Experimentation of the Federal University of Sergipe (CEPA-UFS - 91/11). Test of the induced convulsions for pentilenotetrazol the inhibition of the induced convulsions for pentilenotetrazol (PTZ) is a methodology extensively used to evaluate the anticonvulsivante effect of ` drugs in animals (Lowson, S.; Gent, J. P.; Goodchild, C. S. Convulsive thresholds in anesthesia mice during the recovery phase from induced by propofol, thiopentone, methohexitone and etomidate.Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior. 879 - 882, 1991. ; Quintans-Junior LJ, Almeida JRGS, Lima JT, Nunes XP, Siqueira JS, Oliveira LEG, Almeida RN, Athayde-Son PF, Barbosa - Son JM. 2008a. Plants with anticonvulsant properties: review.Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 18: 798-819), Sendo considered as an experimental model for ""convulsive crises generalized of absence"" (Oliveira, F.; Almeida, R. N.; Sousa, M. F. V.; Barbosa - Son, J. M.; Diniz, S. A.; Medeiros, I. the Anticonvulsant properties of N-salicyloyltryptamine in mice.Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, 68:199-202, 2001). Therefore, one knows that the blockade of the induced convulsions chemically for the PTZ, in rodents, is a characteristic of some pertaining depressive drugs of the SNC to the class of the anticonvulsivantes (Smith M, Wilcox KS, White HS 2007. Discovery of antiepileptic drugs.Neurotherapeutics 4: 12-17).
In the search to evaluate dimerico organometalico complex [DIAZPdOAc] 2 as potential anticonvulsivante agent, groups of eight male mice were daily pay - treated, for saw intraperitoneal (i.p.), with solution tween 80 to 0.2% in distiled water (vehicle); [DIAZPdOAc] 2 in them you dose 1,5; 3 and 6 mg/kg (i.p.) and diazepam (DPZ, 6 mg/kg, i.p.).
Group additional was daily pay - treatment with flumazenil (FLU), a selective antagonist of the receivers BRAGS - Benzodiazepinicos (the BDZ BRAGS -), 15 minutes before the treatments with [DIAZPdOAc] 2 or DZP (standard).
Elapsed 60 minutes of the daily pay - treatments were administered, in all the animals, the PTZ in dose of 60 mg/kg (i.p.), as described methodology for Smith et al. (2007). Immediately, after this administration proceeded it comment from the following parameters: latency for the apatecimento of the convulsions, the percentage of convulsions and the number of deaths.The animals were observed during a period of minutes for each animal.
Test of the induced convulsions for the picrotoxina the picrotoxina (PIC) is a powerful stimulant of the SNC Sendo used in the chemical induction of convulsions through the antagonism to the receivers GABAergicos (Zia.; Siddiqui, B. S.; Begum, S.; Suria. the Studies on the constituents of the leaves of Nerium to oleander on behavior pattern in mice.Journal of Ethnophannacology, 49: 33 - 39, 1995; Smith et al., 2007). The reversion of the induced stimulation for the picrotoxina is considered as an effective parameter in the study of drugs of the class of the anticonvulsivantes that act in mechanisms that involve the GABAergico system (Quintans-Junior et al., 2008a).
For this experiment the animals were divided in groups of 8 male mice (n=8, for group).The group control received the vehicle (solution tween 80 to 0.2% in distiled water).The experimental groups were daily pay - treated with [DIAZPdOAc] 2 in them you dose 1,5; 3 and 6 mg/kg (i.p.). The group standard received DZP in doses '4 mg/kg (i.p.). After sixty minutes of the administrations, all the animals were dealt with picrotoxina (PIC) in dose 8 mg/kg (i.p.). After that she was proceeded comment from the following parameters: latency for the appearance of the convulsions, the percentage of convulsions and the number of deaths, during a period of 20 minutes for each animal.Statistical Analysis the statistical analysis of the results obtained in the tests in vivo between the groups was accomplished obeying the particularity of each experiment.The tests of Analysis of Variancia (ANOVA) with a classification were used (disposable), followed of the Test of Tukey for parametric measures and the test of Fisher for measures distribution free.The results alone were considered significant when they had presented p < 0,05. RESULTS
The results show that the acute treatment with dimero [DIAZPdOAc] 2 in the test of the induced convulsions for pentilenotetrazo 1 was effective in all doses them, increasing, in significant way (0.01 p < or p < 0.001), the time of latency for the tripping them convulsions.The composition diminished, in significant way (0.01 p < or p < 0.001), the percentage of convulsions, presenting percentile of protection of 70%, 90% and 100% for you dose them of 1,5, 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively.It Was Observed despite they diazepam it (DZP, 6 mg/kg, i.p.); the drug reference, was effective in all the evaluated parameters.
The composition, [DIAZPdOAc] 2, - its anticonvulsivante effect reverted by the flumazenil had.Therefore, [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 this result suggest that it acts in the same place of connection of diazepam it, in the receiver BRAG - the Benzodiazepinicos.
Evaluation of the anticonvulsivante activity With intention to evaluate the anticonvulsivante activity of the dimericos paladaciclos derivatives of diazepam it ([DIAZPdOAc] 2 e [DIAZPdC1] 2), was selected two types of pharmacological tests, one that uses the PTZ and the other the PIC as inductive of the convulsions.The choice of these tests was accomplished these to be os.testes of selection of used anticonvulsivantes medications more in the world (QUINTANS- JUNIOR et al., 2008) and for the fact of the reversion of the induced stimulation in such a way for the PTZ
how much it PIC to be considered an effective parameter in the composite study that presents action mechanisms that they involve the GABAergico system, is important to stand out that the dimeros complex are derived from a medication that presents its action through the connection to the GABAergicos receivers.
They diazepam It was chosen as medication standard in these tests for the fact of the dimericos paladaciclos to be derived from this medication and, mainly, to block the convulsions acting in canals for ions chloride associates to BRAGS, thus facilitating it the GABAergica transmission (LAMBERTY et al., 2002).
Induced Convulsions for the PTZ
The PTZ is a powerful convulsivante agent, who acts inducing convulsions to inhibit canals of ions chloride associates the receivers BRAGS if binding to a specific place in this ionic canal (LOSCHER & SCHMIDT, 2002; 2006). Moreover, the PTZ can still induce convulsions for a excitatorio effect direct on the neuronais membranes (FAINGOLD, 1987). Although the effects of.PTZ well are established, its accurate mechanism of action still are obscure.
The inhibition of the induced convulsions for the PTZ is a methodology extensively used to evaluate the anticonvulsivante effect of drugs in animals (LOWSON et al., 1991; QUINTANS-JUNIOR et al., 2008), Sendo the experimental model of selection of new used anticonvulsivantes medications more in world (MELDRUM, 2002;
LOSCHER & SCHMIDT, 2006). Therefore, one knows that the blockade of the induced convulsions chemically for the PTZ, in rodents, is a characteristic of some pertaining depressive medications of the SNC. the class of the anticonvulsivantes (SMITH et al., 2007).
As for the time of latency so that the mice presented the induced chronic convulsions for the PTZ, the results they show that the acute treatment with [DIAZPdOAc] the i increased this time of significant form (p < 0.001) in all doses them tested; already the treatment with [DIAZPdC1] the 2, was statistically significant in biggest doses tested (6 mg/kg).
The treatment with [DIAZPdOAc] 2 e [DIAZPdCl] 2 produced a protection of the animals in respect to the animals of the group controls.However, [DIAZPd0Ac] the 2 presented a protective effect in all dose them tested, with a similar profile to the one of diazepam it, that he was effective as for the time of latency (inhibiting the appearance of the convulsions during all the evaluated time) and to the percentage of deaths (no animal died); whereas [DIAZPdC1] the 2 presented protective effect only in biggest doses.It Is important to stand out that, as only difference between dimeros finds in bridge (atom or group that binds a palladium to another one), these results shows that the group acetate had importance in the better activity of [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 when compared with the activity of the PIAZPdC112.
When we compare [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 with diazepam it, we observe that this dimero inhibited the appearance of the induced convulsions for the PTZ during all the time evaluated (15 minutes = 900 seconds) from the administration of doses of 3,3 gmol/kg, that corresponds the 6,6 approximately gmol of diazepam/kg (since a molecule of dimero is composed for two molecules of diazepam desprotonado), showing that dimero needed one doses three times lesser that the used one of diazepam (21.1 gmol/kg) to obtain the same effect that this medication, indicating an activity potentially greater that of they diazepam.However, the necessity of the accomplishment of more tests exists using diazepam it in doses minors to accomplish one better comparison between [DIAZPdOAc] the 2 and diazepam it, since this medication can present the same result (to inhibit 100% of the convulsions) em' doses minors.When comparing [DIAZPdC1] the 2 in biggest dose tested (7,0 innol/kg) with diazepam it, observe that this complex was not TAO powerful how much the anticonvulsivante medication, but are important to point out that this dimero presented statistically resulted significant exactly Sendo used in one doses correspondent
-14,0 i.tmol of diazepam/kg (since upia molecule of [DIAZPdCl] 2 is formed by two molecules of diazepam desprotonado), Sendo this doses -1/3 minor who doses it used of diazepam (21.1 i.unol/kg).Such results in show the necessity to them of the accomplishment of new tests using diazepam it in dose equivalents of [DIAZPdCl] the 2 for one better comparison between these composites.
Also Searching to evaluate the possible involvement of receivers GABAA- Benzodiazepinicos (the BDZ BRAGS -) in the effects of the dimericos complexes, was administered the flumazenil, a specific competitive antagonist of these receivers (PELLOW, 1986 CADGES &). The results of this test using flumazenil, found in Table 5.5, show that the effects anticonvulsivante of dimeros [DIAZPdOAc] 2 e
[DIAZPdCl] 2 were antagonized by the daily pay - treatment with the antagonist, suggesting a possible effect of these complexes in the same place of connection in the receivers BRAGS - BDZ (QUINTANS-JUNIOR et al., 2010).
Induced Convulsions for the PIC
The PIC is a powerful stimulant of the SNC Sendo used in the chemical induction of convulsions through the antagonism to the receivers GABAergicos (ZIA et al, 1995;
SMITH et al., 2007). The reversion of the induced stimulation for the PIC is considered as an effective parameter in the study of medication of the class of the anticonvulsivantes that act in mechanisms that involve the GABAergico system (QUINTANS-JUNIOR et al., 2008).
The test of the induced convulsions for the PIC in mice was used more better to research the participation of the GABAergico system in the possible anticonvulsivante effect of the dimeros, [DIAZPdOAc] 2 e [DIAZPdC1] 2, since the administration of the PIC (8 mg/Kg, i.p.) seems to produce convulsions to block the conductance of chloride canals associates the receivers BRAGS (the LOSCHER &
SCHMIDT, 2006).
The found results show that the animals that had received the acute treatment with [DIAZPdOAc] 2 in dose of 6 mg/kg (i.p.) were protected and the animal time of latency to enter them in convulsion was increased in significant way (p < 0.01). [DIAZPdC11 2 did not modify none of the evaluated parameters in (...)","EPNC

The infection for the HPV is characterized for apparent, vegetative injuries, vascularizadas, sesseis and with multiple projections papilares, called condiloma acuminado.The majority of these injuries is related with HPV 6 (65%) and the 11 (20%), the remaining with less common types.They Occur, more comumente, in patients between 16 and 25 years.The vaginal injuries for HPV can coexist with warts vulvares in 30% of the patients and more than 85% of them they will have cervical infection.On the Barbatimao Abarema cochliocarpos, known popularly as barbatimao, it is an endemic species of pertaining Brazil to the Mimosaceae family.It Is about small a leafy tree of the average transport, possessing composed leaves, inflorescencia in globosos glomerulos, flourish slightly yellowish, fruits of the type twisted vegetable and grayish white seeds, widely used in natura in Brazil as medicinal plant (Santos et al., 2007). This plant is called popularly of barbatimao, babatimao, pilgrim's staff - of - old (Braga, 1976:
p.89). The etnofarmacologia discloses the use in the combat of infectious processes of Pele, as cicatrizante, in the combat of leucorreias and warts (Correa, 1984; p.199, 200). Some works found in literature describe the chemical constitution of tanning barks found in rinds of the barbatimao.The protobinetinidinas (Mello & Nahrstetd, 1996), the present dimerica proantocianidina in the soluble extract in acetone (Mello and cols., 1999) that it presented antiinflammatory activity (Lima and cols., 1998). State of the Technique the treatments include the use of xicas drugs citoto-, surgical methods and uses of imunomoduladoras therapies can be accomplished using different presented drugs will follow it: a) Desiccative Acids: bicloroacetico or tricloroacetico is effective in humid injuries of mucous membranes due to the raised watery content of these fabrics.These acids must directly be applied on warts, preferentially with magnification of Pele. B) Presents high indices of local return around 30%. Podofilina whose biological effect must it the antimitotico effect.It Has systemic toxic effects: neurological or hepatorrenal toxicity and elimination of bone marrow.It is contraindicated in the pregnancy.The application must be restricted to the queratinizada area of Pele. The success fee is of 20-40% in six months, and through c) the Destrui- focal physical dog in which the eletrocauterio, criocirurgia or ablation can be employed the laser.Indicated in the cases of obstinate cutaneous injuries where the queratina binds it hinders the penetration of the topical medication.The topical therapy will be able initially to treat condilomatose; however, the failure rate in the primary therapy with secondary recurrence is of approximately 50%. The subsequent treatments depend on the appearance of the injury.The coarse, recidivantes and queratinizadas warts better are dealt with methods of physical destruction.The extensive and diffuse picture of warts that grow between each session of treatment, better answers to the treatment with interferon and use of continuous topical therapy.Interferons (derived from leukocyte), r3 (derived from fibroblasto) and y (derived from linfocito) are used in the treatment of viral injuries inducing antiviral, antiproliferativos and imunoestimulantes effects.Interferon intralesional aggravates the topical podofilina answer (Douglas et there., 1990). Interferon systemic supplies to complementary benefits in papilomatose laringea youthful recidivante (Leventhal et a1., 1991) and in the treatment of disease of the larynx in older patients.The 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), indicated as auxiliary in vaginal, antimetabolic the treatment of condilomatose, inhibits the production of acidifies ribonucleic and DNA. The treatment must be individualized to avoid chronic vaginal ulceracoes.Vaginal and plain queratinizadas Injuries do not answer the treatment, as well as condilomas classic.The use of 5-FU has been discontinued for the high fee of complications, including chronic ulceracoes, chemical vaginite, adenose and vestibulite to vulvar.The administration can be topical, intralesional and parenteral, the results are varied with answers generally dose - dependants.The biggest limitations are the high cost and collateral effects.On the other hand, Imiquimode you cremate act as modifier of the immune answer inducing multiple subtypes of interferon it and some citoquinas, between them the Factor of Necrose Tumoral (TNF) and interleucinas.This chain stimulates cells to killer, cells T, polimorfonucleares and macrophages, being increased activity antitumor.It is indicated in the treatment of condilomas acuminados of the external genitals and perianais, being able to be used in the pregnancy (class B). Its use in mucous membrane ocluida, as vagina and cervix, is prohibit due to bigger absorvicao of these mucous.Common collateral Effects with interferon are eritema, itch, scalling off and edema.The cure fee reaches of 50-56% and rare - in less than 5% of the patients - it can will occur chronic headache, myalgias and symptoms simulating flu.Summary of the Invention For the displayed one, evidences it immediate necessity of availability of new drugs for treatments of infections for the HPV. For in such a way, the fitoterapicos products are presented through this instrument of industrial property that include in its formulation cochliocarpos the active beginnings of the Abarema (Gomes) Barneby & Grimes and/or other identified species as barbatimao.The developed products were evaluated in tests daily pay - physicians and physicians, whose resulted therapeutical they represent a new alternative for treatment of infections promoted for the HPV and for the prophylaxis of the cervical cancer.Different of the present solutions in the state of the technique the use of the ointment of Barbatimao in the treatment of the HPV, brings the following advantages: absence of collateral effects, easiness of auto - gestantes application, use SEM restrictions for children and women, low index of local return, around 11%, low which had mainly cost, the prime substance easily to be found in flourishes national, beyond the advantage that the same can internally be used, that is, in rectal, vaginal, peniana and buccal the mucosa SEM to offer risks of collateral effects.Detailed Description of Patent 1. Attainment of extracts: (a) Rinds of barbatimao (Abarema cochliocarpos) wearied droughts and in electric mill (1Kg) are extracted through maceration with ethyl alcohol (92,8 .deg. GL) (3L x 2) for 72h, (b) and after filtration with paper (Watman in. 2) river to 60 was concentrated in evaporator rotato- .deg. C until the volume of 0,1L. 0,4 are obtained Kg of the dry extract, that is, income of 35 to 45% p/p in respect to the dry weight of the rinds and entrecascas.Already the watery extract supplied a 33% income (p/p) whereas the hidroalcoolico extract (9:1) supplied income of 38% (p/p) with identical procedures of preparation to the one of the hydrated etanolico extract (92,8.deg. GL). 2. Preparation of the Ointment: The ointment is prepared being heated vegetal oil (canola) 0,4L and eatable paraffin (70g) in 60 bath-Maria to .deg. C, for 30min. After that, the concentrate volume of the spirituous extract of the barbatimao (0,1L) obtained in item 1, is added slowly, while the mixture is homogenized manually with wooden spoon, becoming movements circulares uniforms for 10min. 3. The container then is removed of the bath-Maria and the homogenization continued for more 15min. The obtained, ready ointment for use, then is transferred to 100 plastic pots of mL and must contains of 20% to 30% (p/p) of it begins asset.Fitoquimicos Studies the studies fitoquimicos, toxicologicos, pharmacological and clinical with spirituous extracts and watery hidroalcoolicos of the barbatimao are described to follow.
Collection of the material botanist the barbatimao extracts were obtained from the vermelhadas rinds and entrecascas of the stalk and the rind of the mature string beans, I at least contend 20% (p/p) of tanning barks.Rinds and entrecascas of stalks of cochliocarpos healthy plants of Abarema in two places Had Been Collected: Arboreto of the Campus Simoes B. C., UFAL, Maceio - AL and of plants of Atlantic Mata of the region of Coruripe - AL. The rinds of the mature string beans of reddish coloration also will count the studied active beginnings.A copy of the Abarema plant cochliocarpos meets in the herbario of the Institute of the Environment of the State of Alagoas (I ME - the AL) under the register mac 8830.
Biological Tests the evaluations of the biological activities of the spirituous extract hydrated (92,8.deg. GL) of the rinds and entrecascas were accomplished on larvae of saline Artemia, and microbiological front to seven species of bacteria, 4 species of Candida (leveduriformes fungi).The essays were accomplished in the Laboratory of Qui- mica of Natural Products of the IQB/UFAL and in the Laboratory of Applied Microbiology of the ICBS/UFAL.
Microbiological Tests the microbiological tests were accomplished with the spirituous extract of rinds and entrecascas of the stalk of barbatimao in ressuspendidos the 100 concentration of mg.mL -1 in methanol solution: water (1:2) (v/v).
In the determination of the antimicrobiana activity, the method of diffusion in Agar of Kirby and modified Bauer was used (MOORISH, 1977). The micro-organisms were rung for 2 pipes contend mL of half liquid BHI and incubated in it heat 37.deg.C for 24h. The presence of turvacao in the way is the indicative of grew - bacterial chin.Then it was added, 1 mL of the BHI (approximately 10 9 microrganismos/mL) in 12 pipes I contend mL of agar Mueller Hinton the temperature of 45.deg.C and shed in plates I contend a base of Bacteriological Agar with the training of wells (0,7cm). Control for each micro-organism with antimicrobials Became standard, cloranfenicol (30 pg mL -1), tetraciclina (30 pg.mL -1), itraconazol (11,6 .micro.g/mL -1), cetoconazol (11,6 I n mL -1) fluconazol (700 .micro.g mL -1) and nistatina (350.micro.g/MI). The ressuspendidos etanolicos extracts in MeOH: H 2 0 (1:2) was added (40 pL of the etanolico extract to each one of the respective wells.The plates were incubated in heat 37.deg.C for a period of 24h. The halos were measured with halometros, Sendo considered halos 10,0 mm as indicating of antimicrobiana activity.All the tests were accomplished in duplicate and the results determined for the inhibition average, in accordance with LIMA, et al., 2002.
The studies of evaluation of the antimicrobiana activity of extracts were accomplished in vitro, using the following micro-organisms: Bacteria - Staphylococcus aureus, aeruginosa Pseudomonas, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes faecalis enteriditis Streptococcus pyogenes and Salmonella, and the leveduriformes fungi - Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei and Candida guilliermondi, all deriving ones of the micoteca of the Laboratory of Applied Microbiology - L@MA, ICBS-UFAL. The hidroetanolicos extracts were active against all the tried micro-organisms.In some cases, obtaining better resulted of what the tested antibiotic, as, for example, front the cepas of aeruginosa P., BAC 57, BAC 101, BAC 104, BAC 105 and BAC 125.
Of the 12 tested aureus cepas of S. with the hidroetanolico extract, 100% of them they had presented resulted satisfactory, mainly front multiresistant cepas BAC 95 and BAC 97.
Already front to the leveduriformes fungi of the Candida sort the cepas of species FUN 05 of C. albicans, with 24 halo mm; Tropicalis FUN 36 of C., with 18 halo mm; FUN 11 of C. krusei, with 24 halo mm; e FUN 46 of C. guilliermondi, with halo 23 mm had presented the best resulted.All the tested extracts had presented resulted front the aeruginosa P., S. aureus and fungi of the Candida sort.The obtained results had demonstrated to the ample specter antimicrobials of the rinds, string beans and seeds of. the cochliocarpos one against micro-organisms of clinical interest.
Toxicologicos Tests the toxicologicos tests were accomplished with microlarvae of saline Ademia and mice of the Mus species musculus.The evaluation of the toxic activity of the spirituous extract (92,8.deg. GL) was accomplished in half saline with microlarvae just erupted of saline Artemia Leach, in the concentrations of 10, 100 and 200pg.mL -1.
For accomplishment of the bioensaios she was used methodology of Santos Pimenta LP, Pinto GB, Takahashi ALREADY, and Silva LG, Boaventura ME. the Biological screening of Annonaceous Medicinal Brazilian Plants using saline Artemia (brine shrimp test).Phytomedicine 10 (2-3) 209 - 212. with adaptations.Each solution was evaluated in the toxic tests in third copies, having used 10 larvae of. the saline one.This experience was kept ambient temperature (26 - 28.deg.C) under artificial illumination for a period 24-hour consecutive.A test controls was prepared using a volume of 5mL of saline solution with 10 larvae of. the saline one, under the same experimental conditions of the described tests previously.The results of these bioensaios had shown that the extract did not present toxicidade in the concentrations up to 100 pg.mL -1.
In the determination of CL 50 (Lethal Concentration) 16 mice of the Mus species were used musculus, healthy, male and female adults and.The animals were weighed in scale half - analytical (0,001g) and divided in 4 groups.In group 1 70pL of the hidroetanolico extract of barbatimao, ressuspendido in water was inoculated intraperitonialmente 0,1g.mL -1. In 2.deg. group was inoculated 75pL and in group 3, 80pL. In group 4, 80pL of water intraperitonialmente distiled, Sendo of this form was inoculated the group controls.It was considered doses it lethal, the concentration that killed 50% of the animals inoculated in 96h. In the dead animals an autopsy for withdrawal of the liver and the spleen for pesagem in half scale was executed - analytical.The remaining livings had received numb inalatoria for sulphuric ether and according to above described procedure, was accomplished exerese of the liver and the spleen for pesagem in scale half - analytical.
The hidroetanolico extract of the rinds and entrecascas of barbatimao, had as DL 50 (It Doses Lethal) the application of 75pL, reaching a 250 dosage of mg.Kg -1. The reduction of the metabolism and taquicardia in the tried animals was observed.
Pharmacological Tests the pharmacological evaluations, daily pay - clinical and clinical of hidroetanolicos extracts of barbatimao they were accomplished in vitro and in vivo, for the following activities: primary irritation of Pele, acute ocular irritation, cicatrizacao and abortive.The mice, males and females of the Mus species musculus, used in the experiments were deriving of the bioterio of the CCBi/UFAL and the bioterio of the CCBS/UFS. The albino rabbits New Zealanders were deriving of criadouros of the city of Maceio. The animals were treated against parasitize (vermifugados) and acclimatized in the bioterio of the CCBi/UFAL.
The tests of primary irritation of Pele were accomplished in accordance with BRITO (1994) and had consisted of the application of the drug on the Pele straightforward of the animals.Adult New Zealanders were used three albino rabbits.The animals were accommodated in individual river steamers the ambient temperature, periods of and clearly dark of 12h, with ration PURINA and water ad libitum.The animals were depilated 24 hours before the application, Sendo demarcated four places of application, two of submitted them to the abrasion.Each animal possuia its proper control.They were applied 500pL of the etanolico rude extract of the rinds (0,1g.mL - 1), in one doses only, on the gauze and later placed in the Pele of the animals.
gauze compress was set with esparadrapo hipoalergico.The animals were placed in separate river steamers in exhibition to the drug for four hours.To the end of the period of exhibition, the analysed region was washed with water.Comments for 1 hour, 24 hours and 72 hours were made after the withdrawal of the compresses.In the place of application of the drug, one searched to verify had the training of eritema, scabs or edemas, in accordance with the system employed for the Federal Hazardous Substances of the United States of America.
A small vermelhidao was observed, SEM edema, during the first 60 minutes of experiment in the Pele who was scarified, having the same missing person before completing the reading of 24h.
In accordance with BRITO (1994), for attainment of the degree of irritation of Pele, provoked for the substance, it must be added the subtotals and be divided for 4, that it is equivalent eritema of Pele straightforward and scarified and eritema and straightforward edema of Pele and scarified, obtaining thus the degree of cutaneous irritability of the substance.The degree of 0,25 was obtained, that it classifies the substance (0-1) as a substance not - irritating.
The test of acute ocular irritation aimed at to analyze reversible modifications on the eyes of rabbits as consequence of the instillation of the hidroetanolico extract of the barbatimao rinds.
Four albino rabbits adult and healthy New Zealanders were the animals chosen for the test.The animals were accommodated in individual river steamers the ambient temperature, periods of and clearly dark of 12h, with ration PURINA
e water ad libitum.The two eyes of each animal were examined 24h before the application of the substance test, avoiding itself thus to work with animals with injury or preexisting ocular defect.
The hidroetanolico extract of the barbatimao was ressuspendido in water in the concentration of 0,1g.mL -1, Sendo instilled 100pL of the extract inside of the conjuntival stock market of the right eye of the animal, after to raise delicately the inferior eyelid of the ocular globe.The eyes of the animals were not washed during first 24h that they had been followed to the instillation of the drug.In the left eye of each animal 100pL of distiled water was applied, serving with control.In the fourth animal 100pL of HCI to 1% in the right eye was instilled, serving the left eye as control.
The eyes were examined 24, 48 after and 72 h after the instillation, with the aid of a oftalmoscopio, observing itself macroscopic injuries in the Iris, conjunctive cornea and comparing them with the eye controls.The quotation of the ocular injuries was made in accordance with the illustrated guide of ocular irritation (BRITO, 1994).
In accordance with the accomplished tests in vivo, we can evidence that it did not have percipient reaction in the cornea, conjunctive Iris and after 100 instillation of pL of extract of barbatimao to 20%, in comparison with the positive control with HCI 1% and controls negative with distiled water.In the pharmacological tests ocular modifications and nor primary irritation of Pele were not observed.In the cicatrizacao test adult and healthy New Zealanders were used 36 albino rabbits, weighing between 1250 and 1700 Kg. The animals were depilated and accomodated in individual river steamers the ambient temperature, periods of and clearly dark of 12h, with ration PURINA and water ad libitum.
The animals had received numb local with inalatoria cloridrato of lidocaina and with sulphuric ether.Four incisions in the Pele of each animal until reaching the subcutaneous one were made, keeping a distance of approximately 3 cm of each cut.
The animals were divided in 3 groups: The group, control, received treatment during the 14 days from experiment from saline solution from NaCI to 0.9%. Group B was dealt with rifamicina and group C received the etanolico extract from the barbatimao houses, ressuspendidos in water (0,1g/mL). The cuts had stayed open and the animals had received the treatment since the day from the incision until 14.deg. day from experiment.In 7.deg. of experiment, the withdrawal of the parts of 1/3 of the animals and part of the liver for histological analysis was made, Sendo the sacrificed animals later.In 14.deg. day of experiment, after sacrificed, the parts and part of the liver were removed of the excessively animal ones and led for histological analysis.Macroscopic analyses how much to the degree of cicatricial and microscopical retention how much to the epitelizacao degree were made, intensity of the inflammatory reaction, type of inflammatory reaction and presence of neovascularizacao in accordance with ARAUJO et al. (1998).
It Can be evidenced that the injuries accomplished surgically and dealt daily with extract to barbatimao, rifamicina and sterile salt mine, had presented a different profile in the cure process.Of this form, we notice that the bar extract - batimao propitiated one better action until the 72 treatment h, where the purulent secretion presence was not observed.The same did not happen with the tests using rifamicina and saline solution, where dog was evidenced the purulent presence of secre-.
The barbatimao presented optimum cicatrizante activity, verified mainly in first 72h, Sendo better that treated with rifamicina and the saline solution.The barbatimao favoured the disappearance of the purulent secretion, favoured the hiperemia and appearance of granulation fabric.
In the test of abortive activity twenty and eight adult and healthy mice were used, Sendo twenty and one females and seven males.The animals were mated by a period of 96 h, a male and three females.The males were despised and the females were separate in 3 groups: in group 1 they had stayed eight animals, in the group 2 eight animals and the group 3 five animals.Group 1 received the watery extract hot from the rinds in the concentration of 0,5% for a period of 4 days, alternating 12 h water and 12 h extract, after desacasalamento.Group 2, received the extract from 5.deg. day until 8.deg. day of experiment, alternating 12 water h and 12 extract h. Group 3 was the control, receiving only water during the experiment.

""COMPOSITION THE BASE OF [QUITOSANA] AS INHIBITING OF CORROSION
IN STEEL""
Field of the Invention
Pioneer Patent of an inhibiter of corrosion for steel in based alkaline way in [quitosana] - one [biopolimero] natural.
The inhibiter use of corrosion of the steel in alkaline environment has industrial in some processes, as for example chemical, petroliferous, petrochemical industries and naval application.Beyond the industrial application, the alkaline way is the base of performance of construction, considering that the concrete are regularly alkaline, with [pH] of the order of 13.Thus, the investigation of the corrosion and of I inhibited dog of this for the composition proposal, can be accomplished in saturated watery solution of calcium hydroxide for similarity with the concrete environment.
The use of corrosion inhibiters aims at to reduce the risks of bigger damages to the structures, drawing out the useful life and reducing investments in maintenance.
This is the main reason for which it has an incessant search for more effective inhibiters of corrosion for use in concrete structure.It Enters some methods of control of the corrosion, the corrosion inhibiter use is very used, more attractive of the economic, easy point of view to apply and it offers the advantage of application in the place, SEM to cause significant interruption in the process.The inhibition additives do not have to change the characteristics of the concrete, such as mechanical resistance and dimensional stability.One of the advantages of the inhibiter use in the concrete is that they easily are added to the water of kneading during the preparation, needing, therefore, specialized workmanship and is not distributed in all the mass of the material.
The organic inhibiters have been wide used, once they are effective and its cost is attractive.
The [quitosana] is a amino [polissacarideo], derivative of the process of [desacetilizacao] of the [quitina], that constitutes biggest fraction of the [exoesqueletos] of the [ceos] insects and [crusta]-, Sendo thus assumed as composed a second organic of the nature, staying only behind the cellulose, having structure as presented the low one, formed for the repetition of units (3 (1-4) 2 amino-2-deoxi-D-glucose ([glucosamina] D).
A great variety of acids can be used [to] solubilizar the [quitosana] such as inorganic acids (nitric, [sulfamico], [cloridico], etc) and organic soluble in water.
State of the Technique
Although the structures of armed concrete are generally very durable, the concrete constructions suffer visible damages, which are attributed to the corrosion of the armors and that in some few years occur after to have been constructed, even so the useful life has been planned for 100 years.This fact leads to a work of maintenance of the structure, generally costly.Therefore, it has a great inhibiter necessity of corrosion for the armors of armed concrete, aiming at the increase of the useful life of the structures.
The Corrosion of the armors is the main cause of the degradation of the structures of concrete in everybody.The chlorides destroy the armors and cause the training of corrosion products.The products of the corrosion occupy a bigger physical volume of what of the bars and cause internal expansion that takes the fissuration and [desplacamento] of the layer of [cobrimento] of the concrete.
It is known that the [nitritos], as clear US 5916483 has been established as an anodic inhibiting cash for the steel carbon, used in the structures of construction.However, it has some limitations for its use, such as environmental restrictions due to the possible effects toxic, mechanism of inhibition and effects of risks possibly happened when not added in enough amounts, and also, the high relative cost of this type of additive.Moreover, they are soluble in water and exactly keep its solubility after to have been incorporated in the materials, causing a reduction of the concentration due its [eluicao].
Literature reports the effect of corrosive inhibition of the organic composition [benzoatriazol] ([BTA]) in the corrosion of steel [CA]-50 in alkaline way, simulating the composition of the solution inside them pores concrete it ([Mennucci] et al., 2009). The authors had evidenced that the improvement of the resistance to the corrosion with the addition of the [BTA] (1,5 [wt]%) in the electrolyte, was better than of the [nitrito] (1,5 [wt]%).
A different boarding involves the additive use of inhibition, environmentally friendly cheap and.
Summary of the Invention
Alternative is treated in present invention, that includes the [quitosana] addition that is a organic inhibiter, in a composition, for use in the inhibition of the steel in alkaline environment.
The aim of the present invention is to reduce the problems of the corrosion due to the contact of the metal with the corrosive way, creating an inhibiter for the corrosion it steel, with a substance that does not cause impact to the environment, either of low cost, biodegradable and of renewable sources.
In a general way, the invention deals with an emulsion to the base of [quitosana], diluted in acidifies ascetic that to provide properties with inhibition of the corrosion of the steel in the structures of armed concrete.
In such compositions, the addition of the [quitosana] produces the [adsorcao] of molecules in the metallic surface, with the training of a film that hinders the diffusion them [ions] of the surface.
Reductions of approximately 70% in the values of the chain of corrosion in tests of polarization of [Tafel], and increase of close to 70% in the value of the resistance of load transference are observed, for the technique of Impedance in essays in steel electrode, in solution of saturated calcium hydroxide, in the presence of [quitosana], when comparative with the SEM solution addition of the [quitosana], taking as control.Also in polarization essay the film in addition was given in superior potentials to the one of the [BTA].
Under the optical one of the Electrochemical one, the inhibiter of the present dumb invention the potentials of corrosion for more anodic and cathodic values, increasing the potential region where the steel stays passive.
When added to the concrete, the same emulsion of [quitosana] in small dosages provoked a significant increase in the resistance the chloride penetration, indicating bigger protection ace immersed armors in this way.
The improvement Is evident that the present invention brings, when the same is compared with the described solutions in the state of the technique, as for example already
cited additions of [nitrito] and [benzotriazol], whose efficiencies of inhibition do not reach the same percentages obtained with use of the [quitosana]. The invention does not have toxic effects, does not possess risks when not added in enough amounts, not cause modifications in the concentration, therefore it does not suffer [eluicao], its cost is inferior to cited in the state of the technique its prime substance to be present it nature and to be renewable and does not attack the nature.
Listing of figures
Figure 1 shows the effect of inhibition of the [quitosana] in the corrosion of the steel CA - 50, in solution of Ca ([OH]) 2 in the presence of sodium chloride, [ressivo] environment highly GAC.
Figure 2 illustrates the electrochemical curves of polarization and allows to evidence the effect of inhibition of the corrosion of steel [CA]-50 in solution of calcium hydroxide saturated in the absence and in the presence of [quitosana], in some concentrations.
Detailed Description of the Patent
(a) 3g of powder [quitosana] with degree of [desacetilizacao] with a break of 70% to 80% Is Added, (b) adds a volume to it of 100m1 of acidifies ascetic, with concentrations of 0,25 0,50M. (c) After the addition, the solution is submitted the constant agitation, with assists of a magnetic agitator to an ambient temperature of 252.deg.C until complete [solubilizacao]. The obtained product can be diluted in solution of acidifies ascetic to reach the desired concentration.
It Is Verified that the concentration enters 00,1% to 3.00% [m]/v of [quitosana] in the composition, in respect to mass [Portland] cement is effective in the inhibition of the corrosion of the steel in alkaline way.
The investigation of the corrosion and the inhibition of this for the composition proposal, was accomplished in watery solution saturated of calcium hydroxide, simulating the concrete environment.
Examples
The following examples illustrates the properties of inhibition of the [quitosana] in solution of saturated calcium hydroxide, using the methods of loss of mass, polarization of [Tafel] and electrochemical impedance.In the examples the concentration of inhibiter is express in [v]/v%.
Example 1
For the experiments of loss of mass the samples were prepared and clean according to the recommendations of Norma [ASTM] G1-90. The samples priorly clean and were weighed before the immersion in 30m1 of the solution of Ca ([OH]) 2 +
3.5% [NaCI] and [quitosana] with concentration varying of 00,1% to 3.00%. After 168 hours the samples were removed of the solution, clean in accordance recommendations of [repesadas] Norma [ASTM] G1-90 and.The experiments were accomplished in duplicates the temperature of 252.deg.C. Each reading was the average of the two readings registered, with approach of 0,0001 g in a digital scale.The results of the loss of mass are shown in table 1.It Is Verified that the loss of mass decreased, with the addition of inhibiter.For effect of the calculation of the efficiency of I inhibited corrosion dog, used it [equacaol]:

More preferentially, the reason of said component is of 1:3. The present invention also mentions to the method of control of the drill of sugar cane-of-sugar with the composition of the invention.
Bases of the Invention
The use of feromonios in I especially cope it integrated of plagues that attack cultures of significant economic value have been very spread out, in the last times. 25 ' Thus, the study, the characterization e' the development of routes of synthesis of the components of these feromonios have been substantially intensified.
Many groups of researchers come working in the identification of the components of feromonios and, today, already the information are available on these components in some databases.For example, ""The Pherobase"" (available in the Web in http://www.pherobase.net/) presents as feromonios of insects of the Diatraea sort composites listed in Table 1.

These researchers had also verified that, in tests of capture in field, the Z11-16 composites: Ald, Z7-16: Ald or Z13-18: Ald separately is inactive, but, in the ternary combination, them they present the same activity of the females virgin.Moreover, these researchers had also observed that removing one of the Z11-16 composites: Ald or Z7-16: Ald of the ternary aldehyde mixture occurs one strong reduction of attractiveness, what it indicates that these two composites are most important for the feromonal activity of the ternary mixture.
According To Mendonca (Mendonca. F. 1996. Plagues of the Sugar cane-of-Sugar. Edited for Artur F. Mendonca - Maceio:
Insetos & CIA, 239 p) approximately has a twenty and species of Diatraea that attack the culture of sugar cane-of-sugar in the American continent, however, only four species, Diatraea grandiosella, D. considerata, D. flavipennella and D. saccharalis, causes serious damages to the sugar cane-of-sugar plantations (to see Mendonca, 1996 and Guagliumi, 1972/73 P.; Plagues of the Sugar cane-of-Sugar (Northeast of Brazil); Rio de Janeiro: IAA, 622p).
The sugar cane-of-sugar culture is recognizably one of most important in the scene of the global economy.Beyond its importance in the production of foods and drinks for human consumption, for example, sugar and derivatives, and in the production of rations, the sugar cane-of-sugar is today one of the most important alternative power plants due to the production of the combustible alcohol.
However, the sugar cane-of-sugar production constantly is threatened by the occurrence of plagues that attack the plantation.The insects of the Diatraea sort are the ones that cause the damages most significant and the biggest losses of the product (to see of Freitas et al. ""The Biology of Diatraea flavipennella (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) Reared to under Laboratory Conditions"". Florida Entomologist, 90(2). Pages 309-313. Junho/2007). In Brazil, the species most common of Diatraea are the Diatraea saccharalis, with occurrence generalized for the whole country, and the Diatraea flavipennella, with predominance in the states of the Rio Grande of the North, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro (to see Botelho, Postscript M. ""Biological Control and Chemical Control of Plagues in Sugar cane-of-Sugar"". Technological Workshop on ""Plagues of the Sugar cane-of-Sugar"". Piracicaba/SP. Agosto/2007).
In the control of such plagues, the use of insecticides more and more tends to be reduced due to the environmental impact that such substances already had caused and continues causing.Restrictions to the use of the insecticides have been extended in all the countries, especially from the end of the last century.
However, it is valid to observe that the efforts to control the populations of insects of the different species of Diatraea with alternative techniques to. use of insecticides not always has been well - occurred.Diverse they are the factors complicadores of this control, being able to be cited the continuous presence of the plant hostess in the field during the year, the activity of feeding of the larvae difficult to detect and the immature forms of the insect, factors these that make it difficult the development of effective strategies of control.The programs of control integrated of the plague (CIP) currently in use for the insects of the Diatraea sort combine a gamma of tactics that include manual collection of the larva, introduction of varieties of sugar cane-of-sugar genetically modified and biological control using parasitoide Cotesia flavipes.For example, in document PI0504495 the saccharalis control of the Diatraea insect is proposed through the transformation of plants of sugar cane-deacucar for the introduction of a genico promoter called SUGARWIN that induces the toxic protein training against this insect.
Thus, the use of feromonios in the control for behavior of plagues comes Sendo faced as alternative interesting insofar as its environmental impact least if it is compared with outras forms of control of plagues.This possibility has contributed in very to the knowledge of the reproductive habits of the insects that attack the plantations of important cultures, as of the sugar cane-of-sugar.More than this, the knowledge of the components of feromonios of insects has been important for the control of plagues, as the one of the insects of the sort
Diatraea.
However, the successive attempts to increase the effectiveness of the program of CIP of D. saccharalis for the introduction of sexual feromonio have failed due to the effectiveness unexpectedly low of the feromonio traps, although the studies of diverse groups of. research (to see, for example, Hammond. the M.; Hensley, S.

Given the importance of the feromonios in biocontrole of insects - plague some proposals of synthesis of feromonios have been told in published works and documents of patent.For example, Svatos et al. they had characterized and they proposed a route of synthesis for the predominant component of the saccharalis feromonio of the Diatraea, the composition (9Z, 11E) - hexadeca-9,11-dienal (to see Svatos. et al. ""Chemical Characterization and Synthesis of the Major Component of the Sex Pheromone of the Sugarcane Borer Diatraea saccharalis"". Collection of Czechoslovak Chemical Communications. Abstracts: 2001, 66(11), 1682-1690. Available Summary in the Web in http://cccc.uochb.cas.cz/Vo1/66/No11/20011682.html).In document US3985813 the synthesis of acetate of (7E, 9Z) - 7,9 is proposal - dodecadien-l-ila and of the intermediate of this synthesis.This substance is known by its activity of feromonio with regard to botrana the Lobesia insect (Schiff). In documents US4198533 and US4228093 the synthesis of (11Z, 13Z) - the 11,13-hexadecadienal one and of its intermediate is described, said substance having feromonal activity with regard to the Amyelois insect transitella.Document US4357474 describes the synthesis of (9Z, 11E) - the 9,11-hexadecadienal one of its intermediate, said substance having feromonal activity with regard to the drill of Diatraea sugar cane-of-sugar saccharalis.Document US4544504 tells the chemical modification of known feromonios, through the substitution of the grouping aldehyde for fluorine.This document commercially brings the relation of some available feromonios.
Therefore, it is possible to say that the main components of known feromonios are available commercially, or are known routes of synthesis for its attainment.
The availability of =componentes of feromonio has allowed the development of compositions with feromonal activity, some of which are found in the market.In document US4632829 a composition of sexual feromonio is disclosed as tinder for the drill of the corn (southwestern corn to borer, Diatraea grandiosella (Dyar)) consisting of 16-26% of Z9-hexadecenal, 56-85% of Z11-hexadecenal and 6-10% of Z13-octadecenal.In document US6355236 a feromonal composition of slow release is described, conditioned in a plastic container, understanding a liquid mixture of: (i) a sexual feromonio that is an aldehyde of 10 to 18 carbon atoms e (ii) one derivative alifatico chosen team of the group consisting of a alifatico acetate, which has 2 to 4 carbon atoms less than what the feromonio and an ester alifatico carboxilato that less has 1 to 4 carbon atoms than the feromonio.
Although some compositions of feromonio are known, it is a known fact that nor all the components are active, what it significantly reduces the activity of the product.More than this, the specificity of the feromonio mixtures disables the extended use of a feromonal composition to all the species of Diatraea.
Therefore, it stays evident the necessity of meeting a feromonal composition where the active components have its activity potencializada for the occurrence of synergism between the active ingredients, allowing, thus, the maximization of the capture of the insects - white at the time of the procreation and, consequently, its control.
Summary of the Invention
The invention aims at the provisions of compositions with feromonal activity where the active ingredients possess synergism to increase to the effectiveness of attractiveness in respect to insects of the Diatraea sort, particularly of the Diatraea species flavipennella.
In one first concretion, flavipennella is provided a composition with feromonal activity with Diatraea having understood: (a) the sinergistica combination of effective a feromonal amount of (Z) - 9-hexadecenal (Z9 -16: A1) and effective a feromonal amount of (Z) - 11 - hexadecenal (Z11-16: THERE), as active ingredients; e (b) an agriculturally acceptable vehicle.
A second concretion says respect to a composition with feromonal activity understanding: (a) the sinergistica combination of effective a feromonal amount of (Z) - 9-hexadecenal (Z9 -16: A1) and effective a feromonal amount of (Z) - 11-hexadecenal (Z11-16: THERE); (b) effective a feromonal amount of at least a component of feromonio of the Diatraea sort; e (c) an agriculturally acceptable vehicle.
The compositions of the invention can, additionally, contain other components such as insecticidal, promotional of growth, herbicides and other substances used in agriculture.
In preferential way, the reason between the components (Z) - 9-hexadecenal (Z9 -16: A1) e (Z) - 11-hexadecenal (Z11 - 16: A1), in the compositions of the invention, varies in the band of 1:1 the 1:10. More preferentially, the reason varies in the band of 1:1 the 1:5 and, more specifically still the reason of said component is of 1:3.
The present invention also mentions to the control of the drill of sugar cane-of-sugar for the application of the composition of the invention to the plantation at the time adjusted, that is, at the time of reproduction where the action of the feromonio makes possible the capture of the insects.

Detailed Description of the Invention
The females of the Diatraea sort liberate feromonio mixtures at the time to attract the males of the procreation.These mixtures of feromonio are species - specific, for example, the females of D. considerata use a composed ternary mixture for (Z) - 11-hexadecenal, (Z) - 7-hexadecenal e (Z) - 13-octadecenal, whereas female of D. grandiosella uses a composed ternary mixture for (Z) - 11-hexadecenal, (Z) - 9-hexadecenal e (Z) - 11 - octadecenal and the saccharalis females of D. use a composed mixture for (Z) - 11-hexadecenal e (9Z, 11E) - hexadeca-9,11-dienal in the ratio of 1:10.
The inventors of the present composition had identified the composites (Z) - 9-hexadecenal (Z9 -16: A1) e (Z) - 11-hexadecenal (Z11 -16: A1) as the components of the binary mixture of the feromonio of the Diatraea female flavipennella (LEPIDOPTERA:
CRAMBIDAE), also known as small drill of the sugar cane-deacucar.
Saccharalis Valley still to observe that the control of D. in fields of sugar cane-of-sugar plantation is, currently, based in the use to cultivate transgenicos of sugar cane-of-sugar and in the release in mass of the Cotesia insect flavipes mattered and commercially cultivated (Arencibia.;
Vazquez, R. I.; Prieto, D.; Tellez, Fr.; Carmona, E. R.;
Coego.; Hernandez, L.; Delariva, G.; Selmanhousein, G. (1997). Transgenic sugarcane plants resistant stem you to borer attack.Moi. Breed. 3, 247-255; Setamou, M.; Bernal, J. S.; Legaspi, J. C.; Mirkov, T. E. (2002). Effects of snowdrop lectin (Galantuhus nivalis agglutinin) expressed in transgenic sugarcane fitness of Cotesia flavipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), parasitoid of the nontarget pest Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae.

Mohyuddin. the I.; Waage, J. K. (1992). Overview of biological-control of lepidoptera in the Caribbean. Fla. Entomol. 75: 477-483). However, this strategy effectively does not function for species D. flavipennella.SEM to want to stay restricted to particular a theoretical explanation, this seems to reflect the ignorance of differences in the physiology and behavior of these two species.
In the studies that had resulted in the composition of the invention, it was verified, in analyses of hexanicos extracts of females virgin of Diatraea flavipennella for connected bidimensional Gaseous Chromatography to the Spectrometry of Masses (GC x GC-TOF-MS), for connected Gaseous Chromatography to Eletroantenografo (GC-EAD) and for micron - reaction of derivatizacao for determination of the position of double connections in insaturados composites, that the sexual feromonio of this plague is constituted by a mixture of two composites, (Z) - 11-hexadecenal
(Z11-16: Ald) e (Z) - 9 - hexadecenal (Z9-16: Ald) in the ratio of 3:1.
The bioensaios lead in laboratory had demonstrated that the answer of males of D. flavipennella to this binary mixture is similar to that one observed for females virgin and extracts of the feromonal gland of females virgin.In other words, the specified mixture above is the sexual feromonio of D. flavipennella.The use of this feromonio in I cope it integrated of D. flavipennella and of other insects of the Diatraea sort it will make possible the effective control of canade-sugar drill, that is, the control of this plague in the canaviais where these species had been established successfully.
The activity of feromonio of the composition of the invention is the result of the sinergistica action of the active ingredients (Z) - 11-hexadecenal (Z11-16: A1d) e (Z) - 9-hexadecenal (Z9- 16: Ald).
In one of the concretions, the composition of the invention understands, additionally to the combination of the components of feromonio of Diatraea flavipennella, other components feromonio of other species of Diatraea, such as:

EXAMPLES
The examples to be followed are referring the experiments for identification and characterization of the active components in the feromonal mixture obtained from extracts of glands of feromoniode Diatraea flavipennella.
All the experiments were accomplished in completely random way.For the evaluation of the behavioral answers of males virgin of D. flavipennella to the calling of the females, was considered the hexanico extract of gland of feromonio and synthetic mixture of components of sexual feromonio in five treatments as it is followed:
- treatment 1: mixture of 75% of Z-11-16: Al + 5% of Z 9-16: Al + 20% of Z-7-16: Al;
- treatment 2: mixture of 80% of Z-11-16: Al + 10% of Z 9-16: Al + 10% of Z -7-16: ;
- treatment 3: mixture of 50% of Z-11-16: Al + 20% of Z 9-16: Al + 30% of Z-7-16: Al;
- treatment 4: mixture of 75% of Z -11-16: A1 + 25% of Z-9-16: Al;
- treatment 5: hexanico extract of glands of feromonio of three females in calling;
- treatment (control): females virgin in calling.
All the experiments were accomplished using four replicatas of each treatment and the changeable following was considered: beating of wing (wing fanning - AA), landing (landing) and rest (resting) on paper of filter impregnated with treatment (PP), display of clasperes opened (showing claspers opened - the CAP) and attempt of copula in the paper of filter impregnated with treatment (TC). Example 1: Extraction from feromonio glands Glands of feromonio of females with 1-2 days of age were excisadas during the period of calling (the end of escotofase).The females in calling were cooled - 20.deg.C per 5 minutes before the excision of the gland.The seventh and eighth abdominal segments of the females were excisados and washed in hexane per 30 seconds (approximately 10 .micro.1 for ovipositor, flask with solvent was kept in dry ice).The extracts were stored -20.deg.C until the use.Before the analysis, the samples were concentrated close to times producing a female - equivalent (FE) in 1 .micro.1.
Insects D. used flavipennella in the experiments are deriving of a colony of laboratory kept in an artificial diet.The original prescription developed by Hensley & Hammond (1998) was modified in cooperation with the Laboratory of Fitossanitaria Assistance and Control
Biological (FITOSSAN, Maceio - AL, Brazil, results not published).The used insects to establish the colony had come of located commercial plantations in the State of Alagoas. The colony was kept 22-26.deg.C, relative humidity of 70 10% and fotoperiodo L: D of 12:12 hours.

FIELD TECHNICIAN
The present invention mentions the employment to it of a drying system, for oxidativa polymerization of Oils or Fats of Vegetal or Animal Origin, Oil - Resins or Alkyd Resins, obtained through the coordination of nitrogenado ligante metallic composites.
More specifically, the present invention deals with the io employment nitrogenados composites, contends functions imina and/or piridina, co-ordinated metallic composites of the type oxides, halogenetos, carboxilatos or acetilacetonatos of magnesium, calcium, barium, strontium, scandium, yttrium, vanadium, niobio, molybdenum, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, titanium, zirconium, tins, lead or metals of the group of rare lands.
ANTECEDENTS OF THE INVENTION
The use of several you leave metallic, as those of cobalt, manganese, zinc, called drying metallic, in the composition of printing inks and varnishes well are known (Buono, F. J.; Feldman, M. L.; In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3th ed.; New York, 3 (1981) 35). These metallic siccatives promote the oxidativa polymerization of the segments present polyunsaturateds in oils, oil - resins and alkyd resins that compose printing inks and varnishes, with the aim to promote the drying.
Another important aspect is that drying based in not complexados metallic metallic complexes they are more effective than ions.To exemplify, the 1,10-fenantrolina and to 2,2 ' - bipiridina they form complexes of coordination with some metals, especially with cobalt and manganese.In many cases an increment of the catalytic activity and the stability of these composites is observed.This already was pointed out, for example, for Canty et al. in Ind. &
Eng. Chem., 52 (1960) 67-70 and more recent stories of literature, presented will follow it, corroborate the displayed one above.
For example, in the article of Warzeska, S. T.; Zonneveld, M.; Gorkum, R. V.; Muizebelt, W. J.; Bouwman, E.; Reedijk In J.; Prog. Org. Coat. 44 (2002) 243, ainfluencia of the use of 2,2 ' - the bipiridina one, co-ordinated the octoato of manganese (II) and octoato of cobalt (II), was evaluated in the drying, with the employment of the substratum linoleato of etila.The use of this composition showed resulted positive on the catalytic activity of the manganese salt, poremsobre the catalytic efficiency of the cobalt salt the effects was not significant. lo Oyman, Z.0.; Ming, W.; van to give Liden, R.; Gorkum, R. V.; Bouwman, E.;
In J.; Polymer 46 (2005) 1731 had told that the coordination of ligante 2,2 ' - bipiridina to the complex acetilacetonato of Mn (III) developed the catalytic activity of this last one, in reactions of oxidativa polymerization.
Although increase of the catalytic, described efficiency in many cases, the drying systems based in these two nitrogenados ligantes present vanities, mainly to those related to the training of insoluble complexes in the systems that compose printing inks and varnishes.It Exists, therefore, one strong demand in order to search alternatives for attainment of more efficient metallic siccatives and that they do not present problems of insolubility when its use.Works of literature indicate this trend and are presented to follow.
In article, of Tanase, S.; Bouwman E., Reedijk, J. In Applied Catalysis: General 259 (2004) 101, is described the studies of the effect of the nitrogenados composite addition, of the type pirazol, on complexes of the type acetilacetonato of cobalt (II). The results had shown that the effectivity of the use of these nitrogenados composites is related to not the aggregate training, that occurs when composites of the type metallic acetilacetonatos are employed half to support.
In article of revision of Gorkum, R. V.; Bouwman, E.; Coord. Chem. Rev., 249 (2005) 1709, are described studies involving the effect of the composite addition nitrogenados, on metallic complexes.The results had shown that this strategy is promising in many cases.
In a general way, the aim of the addition of these nitrogenados composites you leave it metallic, comumente employed in the industry of printing inks, are based, mainly, in the necessity to develop the effectiveness of the siccatives.Summarizing, two reasons can be pointed with respect to the possible role played for the addition of these nitrogenados ligantes: (i) the increment of the solubility of the complexes comumente employees, guaranteeing the possibility of stockage of printing ink; (ii) the modification of estereas and electronic characteristics io of you leave them metallic, so as to modify its behavior front the reactions of oxidativa polymerization.
It Was Revealed, therefore, that literature presents a variety of catalytic systems for oxidativa polymerization, obtained through the coordination of nitrogenados ligantes to you leave them metallic.However, these systems show problems as for the solubility and, also, the catalytic effectiveness still can be developed.
The present invention consists of the nitrogenados composite addition, contends functions imina and/or piridina, leaves it metallic the type oxides, halogenetos, carboxilatos or acetilacetonatos of cobalt, manganese or others.These nitrogenados composites I contend functions imina and/or piridina they give to origin the metallic complexes with accentuated solubility in the half reacional, beyond modifying the characteristics of these complexes, conferring bigger catalytic activity in reactions of oxidativa polymerization.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention mentions the employment to it of a drying system, for oxidativa Oil polymerization or Fats of Vegetal or Animal Origin, Oil - resins or Alkyd resins, obtained through the coordination of nitrogenado ligante you leave it metallic.More specifically, the present invention deals with the nitrogenados composite employment, contends functions imina and/or piridina, leaves it metallic the type oxides, halogenetos, carboxilatos or acetilacetonatos of magnesium, calcium, barium, strontium, scandium, yttrium, vanadium, niobio, molybdenum, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, titanium, zirconium, tins, lead or metals of the group of rare lands.The reactions of oxidativa polymerization, that occur in the segments present polyunsaturateds in oils, oil - alkyd resins and resins that I eat compose printing inks and varnishes, were accomplished through the employment of linseed oil, model of materials employed in the industry of printing inks and varnishes, in the presence of metallic composites modified with composites nitrogenados in io different reacionais times.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
In the laboratory, ree 1/43; e0 of oxidativa polymerization was lead in volumetric balloons of -150 mL, with magnetic agitation (650 rpm) and borbulhamento of synthetic air 80.deg.C. A typical experiment involved 150 g of linseed oil and the metallic and/or ligante precursor in the desired amounts.The reacionais times of the experiments were of 18 hours and in regular breaks of three hours they were removed aliquot with the aid of a pipette of mL, adjusted for the procedure.
The accompaniment of the reaction of oxidativa polymerization was accomplished by the determination of kinematic viscosity for all the aliquot ones (0 - 18 hours).The test of kinematic viscosity was employed with the aim to accompany the evolution of the reaction in function of the time, once the viscosity increase translates the increase of the molecular weight of the system (Meneghetti, S. M. P.; of Souza, R. F.; Hunter. the L.; of Souza, M.0.; In J.; Prog. Org. Coat. 33 (1998) 219).
To follow the present invention will be illustrated by the Examples below, that they do not have to be considered limitative of the same.
EXAMPLES 1 to 13
These Examples demonstrate that the reaction of oxidativa polymerization of the present process can be accomplished using diverse metal composites and nitrogenados ligantes I contend the functions imina and/or piridina.Table 1 (page 9/9) also demonstrates that, in similar conditions, the presented examples involving the metal manganese, the use of nitrogenados composites I contend functions imina and/or piridina, led to the training of materials of bigger molecular mass, in comparison to the reactions lead in the absence of these (Example 8 to 13).In the case of the metal cobalt, in a case the use of nitrogenados composites, I contend functions imina and/or piridina, it led to the training of oligomericos or polimericos materials of bigger molecular mass (Example 6). In the too much cases it did not have significant modification in the values of viscosity.The invention described and demanded here allows an ample variety of reacionais conditions for the reaction of oxidativa polymerization, and in all the presented examples, the use of nitrogenados composites I contend functions imina and/or piridina, led to the training of oligomericos or polimericos materials of bigger molecular mass, in comparison to the reactions lead in the absence of these.
